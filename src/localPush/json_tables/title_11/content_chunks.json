Such objection or assertion will be discussed by the Commission at the next scheduled closed meeting, to determine whether the matter in question should be discussed in a closed meeting.\n\n(ii) An objection for the record only will not cause the objection to be placed on any agenda.\n\n(d) Public statement of vote. (1) If the Commission votes to close a meeting, or any portion thereof, under this section, it shall make publicly available within 24 hours a written statement of the vote. The written statement shall contain:\n\n(i) A citation to the provision(s) of 11 CFR 2.4 under which the meeting was closed to public observation and an explanation of why the specific discussion comes within the cited exemption(s);\n\n(ii) The vote of each Commissioner participating in the vote;\n\n(iii) A list of the names of all persons expected to attend the closed meeting and their affiliation. For purposes of this section, affiliation means title or position, and name of employer, and in the case of a representative, the name of the person represented. In the case of Commission employees, the statement will reflect, through the use of titles rather than individual names, that the Commissioners, specified division heads and their staff will attend; and\n\n(iv) The signature of the Commission Secretary.\n\n(2) The original copy of the statement shall be maintained by the Commission Secretary. A copy shall be posted on a public bulletin board located in the Commission's Public Records Office.\n\n(e) Public request to close a meeting. A person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting may request that the Commission close that portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in 11 CFR 2.4. The following procedures shall apply to such requests:\n\n(1) The request must be made in writing and shall be directed to the Chairman of the Commission.\n\n(2) The request shall identify the provisions of 11 CFR 2.4 under which the requestor seeks to close all or a portion of the meeting.\n\n(3) A recorded vote to close the meeting or a portion thereof shall be taken.\n\n(4) Requests made under this section shall become part of the official record of the underlying matter and shall be disclosed in accordance with 11 CFR 2.6 on completion of the matter.\n\n(5) If the Commission decides to approve a request to close, the Commission will then follow the procedures for closing a meeting set forth in 11 CFR 2.5 (a) through (d).\n\n[50 FR 39972, Oct. 1, 1985, as amended at 65 FR 9206, Feb. 24, 2000]",

    "content": "As used in this part:\n\n(a) Commission means the Federal Election Commission, established by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended.\n\n(b) Commissioner means an individual appointed to the Federal Election Commission pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30106(a).\n\n(c) Request means to seek the release of records under 5 U.S.C. 552.\n\n(d) Requestor is any person who submits a request to the Commission.\n\n(e) Act means the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended by the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, 1976, and 1979, and unless specifically excluded, includes chapters 95 and 96 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 relating to public financing of Federal elections.\n\n(f) Public Disclosure and Media Relations Division of the Commission is that division which is responsible for, among other things, the processing of requests for public access to records which are submitted to the Commission pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30108(d), 30109(a)(4)(B)(ii), and 30111(a).\n\n(g) Direct costs means those expenditures which the Commission actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requestors, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating equipment. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the cost of space and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.\n\n(h) Search means all time spent reviewing, manually or by automated means, Commission records for the purpose of locating those records that are responsive to a FOIA request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Search time does not include review of material in order to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure.\n\n(i) Review means the process of examining a document located in response to a commercial use request to determine whether any portion of the document located is exempt from disclosure. Review also refers to processing any document for disclosure, i.e., doing all that is necessary to excise exempt portions of the document and otherwise prepare the document for release. Review does not include time spent by the Commission resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.\n\n(j) Duplication means the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Examples of the form such copies can take include, but are not limited to, paper copy, audio-visual materials, or digital storage device.\n\n(k) Commercial use means a purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requestor or the person on whose behalf the request is made. The Commission's determination as to whether documents are being requested for a commercial use will be based on the purpose for which the documents are being requested. Where the Commission has reasonable cause to doubt the use for which the requestor claims to have made the request or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the Commission will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.\n\n(l) Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.\n\n(m) Non-commercial scientific institution means an organization that is not operated on a commercial basis, as that term is defined in paragraph (k) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.\n\n(n) Representative of the news media means a person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include, but are not limited to, television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of news, as defined in this paragraph) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. A freelance journalist may be regarded as working for a news organization and therefore considered a representative of the news media if that person can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication by that news organization, even though that person is not actually employed by that organization. The best means by which a freelance journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication by a news organization is by having a publication contract with that news organization. When no such contract is present, the Commission will look to the freelance journalist's past publication record in making this determination.\n\n(o) Record and any other term used in this part in reference to information includes any information that would be a Commission record subject to the requirements of this part when maintained by the Commission in any format, including an electronic format.\n\n[44 FR 33368, June 8, 1979, as amended at 45 FR 31291, May 13, 1980; 52 FR 39212, Oct. 21, 1987; 65 FR 9206, Feb. 24, 2000; 79 FR 77844, Dec. 29, 2014; 81 FR 92439, Dec. 23, 2016; 89 FR 213, Jan. 2, 2024]",

These indexes and supplements shall be published and made available on at least a quarterly basis for public distribution unless the Commission determines by Notice in the Federal Register that publication would be unnecessary, impracticable, or not feasible due to budgetary considerations. Nevertheless, copies of any index or supplement shall be made available upon request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.\n\n(d) The Freedom of Information Act and the provisions of this part apply only to existing records; they do not require the creation of new records.\n\n(e) If documents or files contain both disclosable and nondisclosable information, the nondisclosable information will be deleted and the disclosable information released unless the disclosable portions cannot be reasonably segregated from the other portions in a manner which will allow meaningful information to be disclosed.\n\n(f) All records created in the process of implementing provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552 will be maintained by the Commission in accordance with the authority granted by General Records Schedule 14, approved by the National Archives and Records Service of the General Services Administration.\n\n(g) The Commission encourages the public to explore the information available on the Commission's website, located at http://www.fec.gov.

These procedures shall be used for submitting business information in confidence:\n\n(i) A request for confidential treatment shall be addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer and filed pursuant to 11 CFR 100.19(g), and shall indicate clearly on the envelope or subject line, or in a similarly prominent location, that it is a request for confidential treatment.\n\n(ii) With each submission of, or offer to submit, business information which a submitter desires to be treated as confidential under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the submitter shall provide the following, which may be disclosed to the public: (A) A written description of the nature of the subject information, and a justification for the request for its confidential treatment, and (B) a certification in writing under oath that substantially identical information is not available to the public.\n\n(iii) Approval or denial of requests shall be made only by the Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designees. A denial shall be in writing, shall specify the reason therefore, and shall advise the submitter of the right to appeal to the Commission.\n\n(iv) For good cause shown, the Commission may grant an appeal from a denial by the Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designee if the appeal is filed within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the denial. An appeal shall be addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer and filed pursuant to 11 CFR 100.19(g) and shall clearly indicate that it is a confidential submission appeal. An appeal will be decided within twenty (20) days after its receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) unless an extension, stated in writing with the reasons therefore, has been provided the person making the appeal.\n\n(v) Any business information submitted in confidence and determined to be entitled to confidential treatment shall be maintained in confidence by the Commission and not disclosed except as required by law. In the event that any business information submitted to the Commission is not entitled to confidential treatment, the submitter will be permitted to withdraw the tender unless it is the subject of a request under the Freedom of Information Act or of judicial discovery proceedings.\n\n(vi) Since enforcement actions under 52 U.S.C. 30109 are confidential by statute, the procedures outlined in § 4.5(a)(4) (i) thru (v) are not applicable.\n\n(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the Commission, provided that the deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested.\n\n(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\n\n(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:\n\n(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;\n\n(ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;\n\n(iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;\n\n(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;\n\n(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or\n\n(vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.\n\n(b) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records described in 11 CFR 4.5(a)(7); and\n\n(1) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law; and\n\n(2) There is reason to believe that—\n\n(i) The subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency; and\n\n(ii) Disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;\n\n(c) Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.

A requester will be promptly advised if the records cannot be located on the basis of the description given and that further identifying information must be provided before the request can be satisfied.\n\n(2) Requests for Commission records and copies thereof shall specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the response. The Commission shall accommodate requesters as to form or format if the record is readily available in that form or format. When requesters do not specify the form or format of the response, the Commission shall respond in the form or format in which the document is most accessible to the Commission.\n\n(c) The Commission shall determine within twenty working days after receipt of a request, or twenty working days after an appeal is granted, whether to comply with such request, unless in unusual circumstances the time is extended or subject to § 4.9(f)(3), which governs advance payments. The Commission shall immediately notify the requester of such determination, the reasons therefor, and the right of the requester to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison for the Commission and to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services. In the event the time is extended, the requester shall be notified of the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be made, but in no case shall the extended time exceed ten working days.

Requests for records are processed in the order they are received within each track. Upon receipt of a request for records, the Commission shall determine which track is appropriate for the request. The Commission may contact requesters whose requests do not appear to qualify for the fastest tracks and provide such requesters the opportunity to limit their requests so as to qualify for a faster track. Requesters who believe that their requests qualify for the fastest tracks and who wish to be notified if the Commission disagrees may so indicate in the request and, where appropriate and feasible, shall also be given an opportunity to limit their requests.\n\n(g) The Commission shall consider requests for the expedited processing of requests in cases where the requester demonstrates a compelling need for such processing.\n\n(1) The term compelling need means:\n\n(i) That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or\n\n(ii) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal government activity.\n\n(2) Requesters for expedited processing must include in their requests a statement setting forth the basis for the claim that a “compelling need” exists for the requested information, certified by the requester to be true and correct to the best of his or her knowledge and belief.\n\n(3) The Commission shall determine whether to grant a request for expedited processing and notify the requester of such determination within ten days of receipt of the request. Denials of requests for expedited processing may be appealed as set forth in § 4.8. The Commission shall expeditiously determine any such appeal. As soon as practicable, the Commission shall process the documents responsive to a request for which expedited processing is granted.\n\n(h) Any person denied access to records by the Commission shall be notified immediately giving reasons therefor, and notified of the right of such person to appeal such adverse determination to the Commission within 90 days from the date of the adverse determination and the right of such person to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison for the Commission or the Office of Government Information Services.\n\n(i) The date of receipt of a request under this part shall be the date on which the FOIA Officer actually receives the request.\n\n(j) The FOIA Public Liaison is responsible for reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes. The FOIA Public Liaison may be contacted at the address identified in the definition of “Commission” in § 1.2 of this chapter.\n\n[44 FR 33368, June 8, 1979, as amended at 45 FR 31292, May 13, 1980; 50 FR 50778, Dec. 12, 1985; 52 FR 39213, Oct. 21, 1987; 65 FR 9206, Feb. 24, 2000; 75 FR 31, Jan. 4, 2010; 82 FR 60853, Dec. 26, 2017; 89 FR 213, Jan. 2, 2024; 89 FR 35687, May 2, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) Exceptions to fee charges—(1) General. Except for a commercial use requester, the Commission will not charge a fee to any requester for the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages of duplication in response to any FOIA request.\n\n(2) Definition of pages. For purposes of this paragraph, the word pages refers to paper copies of a standard agency size which will normally be 8 1/2″ × 11″ or 8 1/2″ × 14″. Thus, while a requester would not be entitled to 100 free digital storage devices, for example, a requester would be entitled to 100 free pages of a computer printout.\n\n(3) Minimum charge. The Commission will not charge a fee to any requester when the allowable direct cost of that FOIA request is equal to or less than the Commission's cost of routinely collecting and processing a FOIA request fee.\n\n(5) Time limit for compliance. (i) The Commission will not charge a fee under this section to any requester if the Commission does not comply with the time limits in § 4.7(c) or § 4.8(f).\n\n(ii) If the Commission has determined that unusual circumstances (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(iii) and § 4.7(c)(1) through (3)) apply and the Commission provided timely written notification to the requester in accordance with § 4.7(c), a failure to comply with the time limit is excused for an additional 10 days. If the Commission fails to comply with the extended time limit, the Commission may not assess any search fees or, where applicable, duplication fees.\n\n(iii) If the Commission has determined that unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Commission may charge search fees or, where applicable, duplication fees, if the Commission has provided timely written notification to the requester in accordance with § 4.7(c) and the Commission has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with § 4.7(d).\n\n(iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.\n\n(b) Fee reduction or waiver—(1) The Commission will consider requests for the reduction or waiver of any fees assessed pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section if it determines, either as a result of its own motion or in response to a written submission by the requester, that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and that disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\n\n(2) A request for a reduction or waiver of fees shall be made in writing by the FOIA requestor; shall accompany the relevant FOIA request so as to be considered timely; and shall include a specific explanation as to why the fee for that FOIA request should be reduced or waived, applying the standard stated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the facts of that particular request. In addition, the explanation shall include: the requester's (and user's, if the requester and the user are different persons or entities) identity, qualifications and expertise in the subject area, and ability and intention to disseminate the information to the public; and a discussion of any commercial or personal benefit that the requestor (and user, if the requestor and user are different persons or entities) expects as a result of disclosure, including whether the information disclosed would be resold in any form at a fee above actual cost.\n\n(c) Fees to be charged. (1) The FOIA services provided by the Commission in response to a FOIA request for which the requestor will be charged will depend upon the category of the requestor. The categories of FOIA requestors are as follows:\n\n(i) Commercial use requestors. A requestor of documents for commercial use will be assessed reasonable standard charges for the full allowable direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release and duplicating the records sought, according to the Commission's schedule of fees for those services as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section. A commercial use requestor is not entitled to two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of duplication of documents.\n\n(ii) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requestors. The Commission will provide documents to requestors in this category for the cost of duplication of the records provided by the Commission in response to the request, according to the Commission's schedule of fees as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section, excluding charges for the first 100 pages of duplication. Requestors in this category will not be charged for search time. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requestors must show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.\n\n(iii) Requestors who are representatives of the news media. The Commission will provide documents to requestors in this category for the cost of duplication of the records provided by the Commission in response to the request, according to the Commission's schedule of fees as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section, excluding charges for the first 100 pages of duplication. Requestors in this category will not be charged for search time. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, the requestor must meet the criteria listed at 11 CFR 4.1(n) and his or her request must not be made for a commercial use. A request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requestor shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use.\n\n(iv) All other requestors. The Commission will charge requestors who do not fit into any of the categories listed in paragraph (c)(1)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section the full direct costs of searching for and duplicating records in response to the request, according to the Commission's schedule of fees as set forth at paragraph (c)(4) of this section, excluding charges for the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages of duplication. Requests from persons for records about themselves will continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, which permit fees only for duplication.\n\n(2) The Commission may assess fees for the full allowable direct costs of searching for documents in response to a request even if the Commission fails to locate any documents which are responsive to that request and, in the case of commercial use requestors, of reviewing documents located in response to a request which the Commission determines are exempt from disclosure.\n\n(3) If the Commission estimates that search or duplication charges are likely to exceed $25.00, it will notify the requestor of the estimated amount of the fee unless the requestor has indicated in advance a willingness to pay a fee as high as that estimated by the Commission. Through this notification, the Commission will offer the requestor the opportunity to confer with Commission staff to reformulate the original request in order to meet the requestor's needs at a lower cost.\n\n(4) For a paper photocopy of a record, the fee will be $.07 per page, which has been calculated to include staff time. For other forms of duplication, including copies produced by computer, the Commission will charge the direct costs, including staff time and the actual cost of any digital storage device provided. The Commission will charge $7.50 for certification of a document. The Commission will not charge a fee for ordinary packaging and mailing of records requested. When a request for special mailing or delivery services is received the Commission will package the records requested. The requestor shall make all arrangements for pick-up and delivery of the requested materials. The requestor shall pay all costs associated with special mailing or delivery services directly to the courier or mail service.\n\n(5) The Commission will advise the requestor of the identity of any private contractor who will perform the duplication services. If fees are charged for such services, they shall be made payable to that private contractor and shall be forwarded to the Commission.\n\n(d) Interest charges. FOIA requestors should pay fees within 30 days following the day on which the invoice for that request was sent to the requestor. If the invoice is unpaid on the 31st day following the day on which the invoice was sent, the Commission will begin assessing interest charges, which will accrue from the date the invoice was mailed. Interest will be charged at a rate that is equal to the average investment rate for the Treasury tax and loan accounts for the 12-month period ending on September 30 of each year, rounded to the nearest whole percentage point, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. The accrual of interest will be stayed by the Commission's receipt of the fee, even if the fee has not yet been processed.\n\n(e) Aggregating requests. A requestor may not file multiple requests, each seeking portions of a document or documents, in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Commission reasonably believes that a FOIA requestor or group of requestors acting in concert is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Commission will aggregate any such requests and charge the appropriate fees. In making this determination, the Commission will consider the time period in which the requests have occurred, the relationship of the requestors, and the subject matter of the requests.\n\n(f) Advance payments. The Commission will require a requestor to make an advance payment, i.e., a payment before work is commenced or continued on a request, when:\n\n(1) The Commission estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requestor may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. In such a case, the Commission will notify the requestor of the likely cost and, where the requestor has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment, or in the case of a requestor with no FOIA fee payment history, the Commission will require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges; or\n\n(2) A requestor has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing). In such a case, the Commission may require that the requestor pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest or demonstrate that the fee has been paid and make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Commission begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requestor.\n\n(3) If the provisions of paragraph (f) (1) or (2) of this section apply, the administrative time limits prescribed in 11 CFR 4.7(c) will begin only after the Commission has received the payments or the requestor has made acceptable arrangements to make the payments required by paragraph (f) (1) or (2) of this section.\n\n[52 FR 39213, Oct. 21, 1987, as amended at 75 FR 31, Jan. 4, 2010; 89 FR 213, Jan. 2, 2024; 89 FR 35687, May 2, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. The Commission will operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—\n\n(1) Necessarily require the Commission to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;\n\n(2) Require the Commission to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. The Commission has the burden of proving that compliance with 11 CFR 6.150(a) would result in such alterations or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Commission after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Commission will take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such a burden but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.\n\n(b) Methods. The Commission may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The Commission is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The Commission, in making alterations to existing buildings, will meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the Commission will give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.\n\n(c) Time period for compliance. The Commission will comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes will be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.\n\n(d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the Commission will develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan will be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons and organizations representing handicapped persons. A copy of the transition plan will be made available for public inspection. The plan will, at a minimum—\n\n(1) Identify physical obstacles in the Commission's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;\n\n(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;\n\n(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period;\n\n(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan; and\n\n(5) Identify the persons or groups with whose assistance the plan was prepared.",

A link to that site is available on the Federal Election Commission's website, http://www.fec.gov. If the Federal Communications Commission's website indicates that a communication cannot be received by 50,000 or more persons in the specified Congressional district or State, then such information shall be a complete defense against any charge that such communication constitutes an electioneering communication, so long as such information is posted on the Federal Communications Commission's website on or before the date the communication is publicly distributed.\n\n(ii) If the Federal Communications Commission's website does not indicate whether a communication can be received by 50,000 or more persons in the specified Congressional district or State, it shall be a complete defense against any charge that a communication reached 50,000 or more persons when the maker of a communication:\n\n(A) Reasonably relies on a writing obtained from the broadcast station, radio station, cable system, or satellite system that states that the communication cannot be received by 50,000 or more persons in the specified Congressional district (for U.S. House of Representatives candidates) or State (for U.S. Senate candidates or presidential primary candidates);\n\n(B) Does not publicly distribute the communication on a broadcast station, radio station, or cable system, located in any Metropolitan Area in the specified Congressional district (for U.S. House of Representatives candidates) or State (for U.S. Senate candidates or presidential primary candidates); or\n\n(C) Reasonably believes that the communication cannot be received by 50,000 or more persons in the specified Congressional district (for U.S. House of Representatives candidates) or State (for U.S. Senate candidates or presidential primary candidates).\n\n(7)(i) Can be received by 50,000 or more persons means—\n\n(A) In the case of a communication transmitted by an FM radio broadcast station or network, where the Congressional district or State lies entirely within the station's or network's protected or primary service contour, that the population of the Congressional district or State is 50,000 or more; or\n\n(B) In the case of a communication transmitted by an FM radio broadcast station or network, where a portion of the Congressional district or State lies outside of the protected or primary service contour, that the population of the part of the Congressional district or State lying within the station's or network's protected or primary service contour is 50,000 or more; or\n\n(C) In the case of a communication transmitted by an AM radio broadcast station or network, where the Congressional district or State lies entirely within the station's or network's most outward service area, that the population of the Congressional district or State is 50,000 or more; or\n\n(D) In the case of a communication transmitted by an AM radio broadcast station or network, where a portion of the Congressional district or State lies outside of the station's or network's most outward service area, that the population of the part of the Congressional district or State lying within the station's or network's most outward service area is 50,000 or more; or\n\n(E) In the case of a communication appearing on a television broadcast station or network, where the Congressional district or State lies entirely within the station's or network's Grade B broadcast contour, that the population of the Congressional district or State is 50,000 or more; or\n\n(F) In the case of a communication appearing on a television broadcast station or network, where a portion of the Congressional district or State lies outside of the Grade B broadcast contour—\n\n(1) That the population of the part of the Congressional district or State lying within the station's or network's Grade B broadcast contour is 50,000 or more; or\n\n(2) That the population of the part of the Congressional district or State lying within the station's or network's broadcast contour, when combined with the viewership of that television station or network by cable and satellite subscribers within the Congressional district or State lying outside the broadcast contour, is 50,000 or more; or\n\n(G) In the case of a communication appearing exclusively on a cable or satellite television system, but not on a broadcast station or network, that the viewership of the cable system or satellite system lying within a Congressional district or State is 50,000 or more; or\n\n(H) In the case of a communication appearing on a cable television network, that the total cable and satellite viewership within a Congressional district or State is 50,000 or more.\n\n(ii) Cable or satellite television viewership is determined by multiplying the number of subscribers within a Congressional district or State, or a part thereof, as appropriate, by the current national average household size, as determined by the Bureau of the Census.\n\n(iii) A determination that a communication can be received by 50,000 or more persons based on the application of the formula at paragraph (b)(7)(i)(G) or (H) of this section shall create a rebuttable presumption that may be overcome by demonstrating that—\n\n(A) One or more cable or satellite systems did not carry the network on which the communication was publicly distributed at the time the communication was publicly distributed; and\n\n(B) Applying the formula to the remaining cable and satellite systems results in a determination that the cable network or systems upon which the communication was publicly distributed could not be received by 50,000 persons or more.\n\n(c) The following communications are exempt from the definition of electioneering communication. Any communication that:\n\n(1) Is publicly disseminated through a means of communication other than a broadcast, cable, or satellite television or radio station. For example, electioneering communication does not include communications appearing in print media, including a newspaper or magazine, handbill, brochure, bumper sticker, yard sign, poster, billboard, and other written materials, including mailings; communications over the Internet, including electronic mail; or telephone communications;\n\n(2) Appears in a news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcast, cable, or satellite television or radio station, unless such facilities are owned or controlled by any political party, political committee, or candidate. A news story distributed through a broadcast, cable, or satellite television or radio station owned or controlled by any political party, political committee, or candidate is nevertheless exempt if the news story meets the requirements described in 11 CFR 100.132(a) and (b);\n\n(3) Constitutes an expenditure or independent expenditure provided that the expenditure or independent expenditure is required to be reported under the Act or Commission regulations;\n\n(4) Constitutes a candidate debate or forum conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 110.13, or that solely promotes such a debate or forum and is made by or on behalf of the person sponsoring the debate or forum; or\n\n(5) Is paid for by a candidate for State or local office in connection with an election to State or local office, provided that the communication does not promote, support, attack or oppose any Federal candidate. See 11 CFR 300.71 for communications paid for by a candidate for State or local office that promotes, supports, attacks or opposes a Federal candidate.\n\n[67 FR 65210, 65217, Oct. 23, 2002, as amended at 70 FR 75717, Dec. 21, 2005; 79 FR 16663, Mar. 26, 2014; 89 FR 214, Jan. 2, 2024]",

The aggregate amount loaned to a candidate or committee by a contributor, when added to other contributions from that individual to that candidate or committee, shall not exceed the contribution limitations set forth at 11 CFR part 110. A loan, to the extent it is repaid, is no longer a contribution.\n\n(3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, a loan is a contribution by each endorser or guarantor. Each endorser or guarantor shall be deemed to have contributed that portion of the total amount of the loan for which he or she agreed to be liable in a written agreement. Any reduction in the unpaid balance of the loan shall reduce proportionately the amount endorsed or guaranteed by each endorser or guarantor in such written agreement. In the event that such agreement does not stipulate the portion of the loan for which each endorser or guarantor is liable, the loan shall be considered a loan by each endorser or guarantor in the same proportion to the unpaid balance that each endorser or guarantor bears to the total number of endorsers or guarantors.\n\n(4) A candidate may obtain a loan on which his or her spouse's signature is required when jointly owned assets are used as collateral or security for the loan. The spouse shall not be considered a contributor to the candidate's campaign if the value of the candidate's share of the property used as collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the loan that is used for the candidate's campaign.\n\n(5) If a political committee makes a loan to any person, such loan shall be subject to the limitations of 11 CFR part 110. Repayment of the principal amount of such loan to such political committee shall not be a contribution by the debtor to the lender committee. Such repayment shall be made with funds that are subject to the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.20 and part 114. The payment of interest to such committee by the debtor shall be a contribution only to the extent that the interest paid exceeds a commercially reasonable rate prevailing at the time the loan is made. All payments of interest shall be made from funds subject to the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.20 and part 114.\n\n(c) For purposes of this section, the term money includes currency of the United States or of any foreign nation, checks, money orders, or any other negotiable instruments payable on demand.\n\n(d)(1) For purposes of this section, the term anything of value includes all in-kind contributions. Unless specifically exempted under 11 CFR part 100, subpart C, the provision of any goods or services without charge or at a charge that is less than the usual and normal charge for such goods or services is a contribution. Examples of such goods or services include, but are not limited to: Securities, facilities, equipment, supplies, personnel, advertising services, membership lists, and mailing lists. If goods or services are provided at less than the usual and normal charge, the amount of the in-kind contribution is the difference between the usual and normal charge for the goods or services at the time of the contribution and the amount charged the political committee.\n\n(2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, usual and normal charge for goods means the price of those goods in the market from which they ordinarily would have been purchased at the time of the contribution; and usual and normal charge for any services, other than those provided by an unpaid volunteer, means the hourly or piecework charge for the services at a commercially reasonable rate prevailing at the time the services were rendered.\n\n[67 FR 50585, Aug. 5, 2002, as amended at 67 FR 78680, Dec. 26, 2002; 79 FR 16663, Mar. 26, 2014; 79 FR 77845, Dec. 29, 2014]",

A loan of money to a political committee or a candidate by a State bank, a federally chartered depository institution (including a national bank) or a depository institution whose deposits and accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Administration is not a contribution by the lending institution if such loan is made in accordance with applicable banking laws and regulations and is made in the ordinary course of business. A loan will be deemed to be made in the ordinary course of business if it:\n\n(1) Bears the usual and customary interest rate of the lending institution for the category of loan involved;\n\n(2) Is made on a basis that assures repayment;\n\n(3) Is evidenced by a written instrument; and\n\n(4) Is subject to a due date or amortization schedule.\n\n(b) Reporting. Such loans shall be reported by the political committee in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(a) and (d).\n\n(c) Endorsers and guarantors. Each endorser or guarantor shall be deemed to have contributed that portion of the total amount of the loan for which he or she agreed to be liable in a written agreement, except that, in the event of a signature by the candidate's spouse, the provisions of 11 CFR 100.52(b)(4) shall apply. Any reduction in the unpaid balance of the loan shall reduce proportionately the amount endorsed or guaranteed by each endorser or guarantor in such written agreement. In the event that such agreement does not stipulate the portion of the loan for which each endorser or guarantor is liable, the loan shall be considered a contribution by each endorser or guarantor in the same proportion to the unpaid balance that each endorser or guarantor bears to the total number of endorsers or guarantors.\n\n(d) Overdrafts. For purposes of this section, an overdraft made on a checking or savings account of a political committee shall be considered a contribution by the bank or institution unless:\n\n(1) The overdraft is made on an account that is subject to automatic overdraft protection;\n\n(2) The overdraft is subject to a definite interest rate that is usual and customary; and\n\n(3) There is a definite repayment schedule.\n\n(e) Made on a basis that assures repayment. A loan, including a line of credit, shall be considered made on a basis that assures repayment if it is obtained using either of the sources of repayment described in paragraphs (e)(1) or (2) of this section, or a combination of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section:\n\n(1)(i) The lending institution making the loan has perfected a security interest in collateral owned by the candidate or political committee receiving the loan, the fair market value of the collateral is equal to or greater than the loan amount and any senior liens as determined on the date of the loan, and the candidate or political committee provides records to show that the lending institution has a perfected security interest in the collateral. Sources of collateral include, but are not limited to, ownership in real estate, personal property, goods, negotiable instruments, certificates of deposit, chattel papers, stocks, accounts receivable and cash on deposit.\n\n(ii) Amounts guaranteed by secondary sources of repayment, such as guarantors and cosigners, shall not exceed the contribution limits of 11 CFR part 110 or contravene the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.4, 110.20, part 114 and part 115; or\n\n(2) The lending institution making the loan has obtained a written agreement whereby the candidate or political committee receiving the loan has pledged future receipts, such as public financing payments under 11 CFR part 9001 through part 9012, or part 9031 through part 9039, contributions, or interest income, provided that:\n\n(i) The amount of the loan or loans obtained on the basis of such funds does not exceed the amount of pledged funds;\n\n(ii) Loan amounts are based on a reasonable expectation of the receipt of pledged funds. To that end, the candidate or political committee must furnish the lending institution records, i.e., cash flow charts or other financial plans, that reasonably establish that such future funds will be available;\n\n(iii) A separate depository account is established at the lending institution or the lender obtains an assignment from the candidate or political committee to access funds in a committee account at another depository institution that meets the requirements of 11 CFR 103.2, and the committee has notified the other institution of this assignment;\n\n(iv) The loan agreement requires the deposit of the public financing payments, contributions and interest income pledged as collateral into the separate depository account for the purpose of retiring the debt according to the repayment requirements of the loan agreement; and\n\n(v) In the case of public financing payments, the borrower authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to directly deposit the payments into the depository account for the purpose of retiring the debt.\n\n(3) If the requirements set forth in this paragraph are not met, the Commission will consider the totality of the circumstances on a case-by-case basis in determining whether a loan was made on a basis that assures repayment.\n\n(f) This section shall not apply to loans described in 11 CFR 100.83.\n\n[67 FR 50585, Aug. 5, 2002, as amended at 67 FR 78680, Dec. 26, 2002; 79 FR 16663, Mar. 26, 2014; 89 FR 215, Jan. 2, 2024]",

(1) A loan derived from an advance on a candidate's brokerage account, credit card, home equity line of credit, or other line of credit available to the candidate, that is used by the candidate solely for routine living expenses, as described in 11 CFR 100.153, does not need to be reported under 11 CFR part 104 provided that the loan, advance, or line of credit is repaid exclusively from the personal funds of the candidate or payments that would have been made irrespective of the candidacy pursuant to 11 CFR 113.1(g)(6).\n\n(2) Any repayment, in part or in whole, of the loan, advance, or line of credit described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the candidate's authorized committee constitutes the personal use of campaign funds and is prohibited by 11 CFR 113.2.\n\n(3) Any repayment or forgiveness, in part or in whole, of the loan, advance, or line of credit described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by a third party (other than a third party whose payments are permissible under 11 CFR 113.1(g)(6)) or the lending institution is a contribution, subject to the limitations and prohibitions of 11 CFR parts 110 and 114, and shall be reported under 11 CFR part 104.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the portion of any loan or advance from a candidate's brokerage account, credit card account, home equity line of credit, or other line of credit that is used for the purpose of influencing the candidate's election for Federal office shall be reported under 11 CFR part 104.\n\n(d) Repayment. The candidate's authorized committee may repay a loan from the candidate that is derived from an advance on a candidate's brokerage account, credit card, home equity line of credit, or other line of credit available to the candidate, directly to the candidate or the original lender. The amount of the repayment shall not exceed the amount of the principal used for the purpose of influencing the candidate's election for Federal office and interest that has accrued on that principal.\n\n(e) Reporting.

(1) This section applies to all campaign travelers who use non-commercial travel.\n\n(2) Campaign travelers who use commercial travel, such as a commercial airline flight, charter flight, taxi, or an automobile provided by a rental company, are governed by 11 CFR 100.52(a) and (d), not this section.\n\n(3) For the purposes of this section:\n\n(i) Campaign traveler means\n\n(A) Any candidate traveling in connection with an election for Federal office or any individual traveling in connection with an election for Federal office on behalf of a candidate or political committee; or\n\n(B) Any member of the news media traveling with a candidate.\n\n(ii) Service provider means the owner of an aircraft or other conveyance, or a person who leases an aircraft or other conveyance from the owner or otherwise obtains a legal right to the use of an aircraft or other conveyance, and who uses the aircraft or other conveyance to provide transportation to a campaign traveler. For a jointly owned or leased aircraft or other conveyance, the service provider is the person who makes the aircraft or other conveyance available to the campaign traveler.\n\n(iii) Unreimbursed value means the difference between the value of the transportation service provided, as set forth in this section, and the amount of payment for that transportation service by the political committee or campaign traveler to the service provider within the time limits set forth in this section.\n\n(iv) Commercial travel means travel aboard:\n\n(A) An aircraft operated by an air carrier or commercial operator certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration, provided that the flight is required to be conducted under Federal Aviation Administration air carrier safety rules, or, in the case of travel which is abroad, by an air carrier or commercial operator certificated by an appropriate foreign civil aviation authority, provided that the flight is required to be conducted under air carrier safety rules; or\n\n(B) Other means of transportation operated for commercial passenger service.\n\n(v) Non-commercial travel means travel aboard any conveyance that is not commercial travel, as defined in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section.\n\n(vi) Comparable aircraft means an aircraft of similar make and model as the aircraft that actually makes the trip, with similar amenities as that aircraft.\n\n(b) General rule. (1) No contribution is made by a service provider to a candidate or political committee if:\n\n(i) Every candidate's authorized committee or other political committee on behalf of which the travel is conducted pays the service provider, within the required time, for the full value of the transportation, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (c), (d), (e) or (g) of this section, provided to all campaign travelers who are traveling on behalf of that candidate or political committee; or\n\n(ii) Every campaign traveler for whom payment is not made under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section pays the service provider for the full value of the transportation provided to that campaign traveler as determined in accordance with paragraphs (c), (d), (e) or (g) of this section. See 11 CFR 100.79 and 100.139 for treatment of certain unreimbursed transportation expenses incurred by individuals traveling on behalf of candidates, authorized committees, and political committees of political parties.\n\n(2) Except as provided in 11 CFR 100.79, the unreimbursed value of transportation provided to any campaign traveler, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (c), (d) or (e) of this section, is an in-kind contribution from the service provider to the candidate or political committee on whose behalf, or with whom, the campaign traveler traveled. Contributions are subject to the reporting requirements, limitations and prohibitions of the Act.\n\n(3) When a candidate is accompanied by a member of the news media, or by security personnel provided by any Federal or State government, the news media or government security provider may reimburse the political committee paying for the pro-rata share of the travel by the member of the media or security personnel, or may pay the service provider directly for that pro-rata share, up to the applicable amount set forth in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(3), (d), (e), or (g) of this section. A payment made directly to the service provider may be subtracted from the amount for which the political committee is otherwise responsible without any contribution resulting. No contribution results from reimbursement by the media or a government security provider to a political committee in accordance with this paragraph.\n\n(c) Travel on aircraft. When a campaign traveler uses aircraft for non-commercial travel, other than a government aircraft described in paragraph (e) of this section or a candidate or family owned aircraft described in paragraph (g) of this section, reimbursement must be provided no later than seven (7) calendar days after the date the flight began at one of the following rates to avoid the receipt of an in-kind contribution:\n\n(1) Travel by or on behalf of Senate, presidential, or vice-presidential candidates. A Senate, presidential, or vice-presidential candidate traveling on his own behalf, or any person traveling on behalf of such candidate or the candidate's authorized committee must pay the pro rata share per campaign traveler of the normal and usual charter fare or rental charge for travel on a comparable aircraft of comparable size. The pro rata share shall be calculated by dividing the normal and usual charter fare or rental charge by the number of campaign travelers on the flight that are traveling on behalf of such candidates or their authorized committees, including members of the news media, and security personnel traveling with a candidate. No portion of the normal and usual charter fare or rental charge may be attributed to any campaign travelers that are not traveling on behalf of such candidates or their authorized committees, or any other passengers, except as permitted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.\n\n(2) Travel by or on behalf of House candidates and their leadership PACs. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (e) and (g) of this section, a campaign traveler who is a candidate for election for the office of Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress, or a person traveling on behalf of any such candidate or any authorized committee or leadership PAC of such candidate, is prohibited from non-commercial travel on behalf of any such candidate or any authorized committee or leadership PAC of such candidate.\n\n(3) Other campaign travelers. When a candidate's authorized committee pays for a flight pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, no payment is required from other campaign travelers on that flight. Otherwise, a campaign traveler not covered by paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, including persons traveling on behalf of a political party committee, separate segregated fund, nonconnected political committee, or a leadership PAC other than a leadership PAC of a candidate for election for the office of Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress, must pay the service provider no less than the following for each leg of the trip:\n\n(i) In the case of travel between cities served by regularly scheduled first-class commercial airline service, the lowest unrestricted and non-discounted first-class airfare;\n\n(ii) In the case of travel between a city served by regularly scheduled coach commercial airline service, but not regularly scheduled first-class commercial airline service, and a city served by regularly scheduled coach commercial airline service (with or without first-class commercial airline service), the lowest unrestricted and non-discounted coach airfare; or\n\n(iii) In the case of travel to or from a city not served by regularly scheduled commercial airline service, the normal and usual charter fare or rental charge for a comparable commercial aircraft of sufficient size to accommodate all campaign travelers, and security personnel, if applicable.\n\n(d) Other means of transportation. If a campaign traveler uses any means of transportation other than an aircraft, including an automobile, or train, or boat, the campaign traveler, or the political committee on whose behalf the travel is conducted, must pay the service provider within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of receipt of the invoice for such travel, but not later than sixty (60) calendar days after the date the travel began, at the normal and usual fare or rental charge for a comparable commercial conveyance of sufficient size to accommodate all campaign travelers, including members of the news media traveling with a candidate, and security personnel, if applicable.\n\n(e) Government conveyances—(1) Travel by or on behalf of candidates, their authorized committees, or House candidate Leadership PACs. If a campaign traveler traveling on behalf of a candidate, an authorized committee, or the leadership PAC of a House candidate uses an aircraft that is provided by the Federal government, or by a State or local government, the campaign traveler, or the political committee on whose behalf the travel is conducted, must pay the government entity, within the time specified by that government entity, either:\n\n(i) The pro rata share per campaign traveler of the normal and usual charter fare or rental charge for the flight on a comparable aircraft of sufficient size to accommodate all campaign travelers. The pro rata share shall be calculated by dividing the normal and usual charter fare or rental charge by the number of campaign travelers on the flight that are traveling on behalf of candidates, authorized committees, or House candidate leadership PACs, including members of the news media, and security personnel, if applicable. No portion of the normal and usual charter fare or rental charge may be attributed to any other campaign travelers or any other passengers, except as permitted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the comparable aircraft need not accommodate any government-required personnel and equipment; or\n\n(ii) The private traveler reimbursement rate, as specified by the governmental entity providing the aircraft, per campaign traveler.\n\n(2) Other campaign travelers. When a candidate's authorized committee, or a House candidate's leadership PAC pays for a flight pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, no payment is required from any other campaign travelers on that flight. Otherwise, a campaign traveler not covered by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, including persons traveling on behalf of a political party committee, separate segregated fund, nonconnected political committee, or a leadership PAC other than a leadership PAC of a candidate for the office of Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress, must pay the government entity, within the time specified by that government entity, either:\n\n(i) For travel to or from a military airbase or other location not accessible to the general public, the lowest unrestricted and non-discounted first-class airfare to or from the city with regularly scheduled first-class commercial airline service that is geographically closest to the military airbase or other location actually used; or\n\n(ii) For all other travel, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.\n\n(3) If a campaign traveler uses a conveyance, other than an aircraft, that is provided by the Federal government, or by a State or local government, the campaign traveler, or the political committee on whose behalf the travel is conducted, must pay the government entity in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(f) Date and public availability of payment rate. For purposes of paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (g) of this section, the payment rate must be the rate available to the general public for the dates traveled or within seven (7) calendar days thereof. The payment rate must be determined by the time the payment is due under paragraph (c), (d), (e) or (g) of this section.\n\n(g) Aircraft owned or leased by a candidate or a candidate's immediate family member. (1) For non-commercial travel by a candidate, or a person traveling on behalf of a candidate, on an aircraft owned or leased by that candidate or an immediate family member of that candidate, the candidate's authorized committee must pay:\n\n(i) In the case of travel on an aircraft that is owned or leased under a shared-ownership or other time-share arrangement, where the travel does not exceed the candidate's or immediate family member's proportional share of the ownership interest in the aircraft, the hourly, mileage, or other applicable rate charged the candidate, immediate family member, or other service provider for the costs of the travel; or\n\n(ii) In the case of travel on an aircraft that is owned or leased under a shared-ownership or other time-share arrangement, where the travel exceeds the candidate's or immediate family member's proportional share of the ownership interest in the aircraft, the rate specified in paragraph (c) of this section (House candidates are prohibited from engaging in such travel); or\n\n(iii) In the case of travel on an aircraft that is not owned or leased under a shared-ownership or other time-share arrangement, the pro rata share per campaign traveler of the costs associated with the trip. Associated costs include, but are not limited to, the cost of fuel and crew, and a proportionate share of maintenance costs.\n\n(2) A candidate, or an immediate family member of the candidate, will be considered to own or lease an aircraft under paragraph (g)(1) of this section if the candidate or the immediate family member of the candidate has an ownership interest in an entity that owns the aircraft, provided that the entity is not a corporation with publicly traded shares.\n\n(3) A proportional share of the ownership interest in an aircraft means the amount of use to which the candidate or immediate family member is entitled under an ownership or lease agreement. Prior to each flight, the candidate's committee must obtain a certification from the service provider that the candidate's planned use of the aircraft will not exceed the candidate's or immediate family member's proportional share of use under the ownership or lease agreement. See paragraph (j) of this section for related recordkeeping requirements.\n\n(4) For the purposes of this section, an “immediate family member” of a candidate is the father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, husband, wife, father-in-law, or mother-in-law of the candidate.\n\n(h) Preemption. In all respects, State and local laws are preempted with respect to travel in connection with a Federal election to the extent they purport to supplant the rates or timing requirements of 11 CFR 100.93.\n\n(i) Reporting. (1) In accordance with 11 CFR 104.13, a political committee on whose behalf the unreimbursed travel is conducted must report the receipt of an in-kind contribution and the making of an expenditure under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.\n\n(2) When reporting a disbursement for travel services in accordance with this section, a political committee on whose behalf the travel is conducted must report the actual dates of travel for which the disbursement is made in the “purpose of disbursement” field.\n\n(j) Recordkeeping. (1) For travel on non-commercial aircraft conducted under paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(3)(iii), (e)(1), or (g) of this section, the political committee on whose behalf the travel is conducted shall maintain a record of:\n\n(i) The service provider and the size, model, make and tail number (or other unique identifier for military aircraft) of the aircraft used;\n\n(ii) An itinerary showing the departure and arrival cities and the date(s) of departure and arrival, a list of all passengers on such trip, along with a designation of which passengers are and which are not campaign travelers or security personnel; and\n\n(iii)(A) The rate for the comparable charter aircraft available in accordance with paragraphs (c), (e) and (f) of this section, including the airline, charter or air taxi operator, and travel service, if any, offering that fare to the public, and the dates on which the rates are based; or\n\n(B) The private traveler reimbursement rate available in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, and the dates on which the rate is based.\n\n(iv) Where the travel is aboard an aircraft owned in part by the candidate or an immediate family member of the candidate, the ownership or lease agreement specifying the amount of use of the aircraft corresponding to the candidate's or an immediate family member's ownership interest in the aircraft, as required by paragraph (g)(1)(i) and (ii) and (g)(3) of this section, and the certification required by paragraph (g)(3) of this section.\n\n(2) For travel on non-commercial aircraft conducted under paragraph (c)(3)(i), (c)(3)(ii), or (e)(2)(i) of this section, the political committee on whose behalf the travel is conducted shall maintain a record of:\n\n(i) The service provider and the size, model, make and tail number (or other unique identifier for military aircraft) of the aircraft used;\n\n(ii) An itinerary showing the departure and arrival cities and the date(s) of departure and arrival, a list of all passengers on such trip, along with a designation of which passengers are and which are not campaign travelers; and\n\n(iii) The lowest unrestricted non-discounted airfare available in accordance with paragraphs (c)(3), (e)(2)(i), and (f) of this section, including the airline offering that fare, flight number, travel service, if any, providing that fare, and the dates on which the rates are based.\n\n(3) For travel by other conveyances, the political committee on whose behalf the travel is conducted shall maintain a record of:\n\n(i) The service provider and the size, model and make of the conveyance used;\n\n(ii) An itinerary showing the departure and destination locations and the date(s) of departure and arrival, a list of all passengers on such trip, along with a designation of which passengers are and which are not campaign travelers or security personnel; and\n\n(iii) The commercial fare or rental charge available in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section for a comparable commercial conveyance of sufficient size to accommodate all campaign travelers including members of the news media traveling with a candidate, and security personnel, if applicable.\n\n[74 FR 63964, Dec. 7, 2009, as amended at 89 FR 215, Jan. 2, 2024]",

For purposes of this section, executive or administrative personnel means individuals employed by a corporation who are paid on a salary rather than hourly basis and who have policymaking, managerial, professional, or supervisory responsibilities.\n\n(1) This definition includes—\n\n(i) Individuals who run the corporation's business, such as officers, other executives, and plant, division, and section managers; and\n\n(ii) Individuals following the recognized professions, such as lawyers and engineers.\n\n(2) This definition does not include—\n\n(i) Professionals who are represented by a labor organization;\n\n(ii) Salaried foremen and other salaried lower level supervisors having direct supervision over hourly employees;\n\n(iii) Former or retired personnel who are not stockholders; or\n\n(iv) Individuals who may be paid by the corporation, such as consultants, but who are not employees, within the meaning of 26 CFR 31.3401(c)-(1), of the corporation for the purpose of the collection of, and liability for, employee tax under 26 CFR 31.3402(a)-(1).\n\n(3) Individuals on commission may be considered executive or administrative personnel if they have policymaking, managerial, professional, or supervisory responsibility and if the individuals are employees, within the meaning of 26 CFR 31.3401(c)-(1), of the corporation for the purpose of the collection of, and liability for, employee tax under 26 CFR 31.3402(a)-(1).\n\n(4) The Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. 201, et seq. and the regulations issued pursuant to such Act, 29 CFR part 541, may serve as a guideline in determining whether individuals have policymaking, managerial, professional, or supervisory responsibilities.\n\n(e) Definition of membership organization. For purposes of this section membership organization means an unincorporated association, trade association, cooperative, corporation without capital stock, or a local, national, or international labor organization that:\n\n(1) Is composed of members, some or all of whom are vested with the power and authority to operate or administer the organization, pursuant to the organization's articles, bylaws, constitution or other formal organizational documents;\n\n(2) Expressly states the qualifications and requirements for membership in its articles, bylaws, constitution or other formal organizational documents;\n\n(3) Makes its articles, bylaws, constitution or other formal organizational documents available to its members;\n\n(4) Expressly solicits persons to become members;\n\n(5) Expressly acknowledges the acceptance of membership, such as by sending a membership card or including the member's name on a membership newsletter list; and\n\n(6) Is not organized primarily for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any individual for Federal office.\n\n(f) Definition of members. For purposes of this section, the term members includes all persons who are currently satisfying the requirements for membership in a membership organization, affirmatively accept the membership organization's invitation to become a member, and either:\n\n(1) Have some significant financial attachment to the membership organization, such as a significant investment or ownership stake; or\n\n(2) Pay membership dues at least annually, of a specific amount predetermined by the organization; or\n\n(3) Have a significant organizational attachment to the membership organization that includes: affirmation of membership on at least an annual basis and direct participatory rights in the governance of the organization. For example, such rights could include the right to vote directly or indirectly for at least one individual on the membership organization's highest governing board; the right to vote on policy questions where the highest governing body of the membership organization is obligated to abide by the results; the right to approve the organization's annual budget; or the right to participate directly in similar aspects of the organization's governance.\n\n(g) Additional considerations in determining membership. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section, the Commission may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that persons who do not precisely meet the requirements of the general rule, but have a relatively enduring and independently significant financial or organizational attachment to the organization, may be considered members for purposes of this section. For example, student members who pay a lower amount of dues while in school, long term dues paying members who qualify for lifetime membership status with little or no dues obligation, and retired members may be considered members of the organization.\n\n(h) Members of local unions. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section, members of a local union are considered to be members of any national or international union of which the local union is a part and of any federation with which the local, national, or international union is affiliated.\n\n(i) National federation structures.

The factors set forth at 11 CFR 100.5(g)(2), (3) and (4) shall be used to determine whether entities are affiliated for purposes of this paragraph.\n\n(j) Non-applicability of state law in determining status of membership organizations. The status of a membership organization, and of members, for purposes of this section, shall be determined pursuant to paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section and not by provisions of state law governing unincorporated associations, trade associations, cooperatives, corporations without capital stock, or labor organizations.\n\n(k) Definition of election. For purposes of this section, election means two separate processes in a calendar year, to each of which the $2,000 threshold described above applies separately. The first process is comprised of all primary elections for Federal office, whenever and wherever held; the second process is comprised of all general elections for Federal office, whenever and wherever held. The term election shall also include each special election held to fill a vacancy in a Federal office (11 CFR 100.2(f)) or each runoff election (11 CFR 100.2(d)).\n\n(l) Definition of corporation. For purposes of this section, corporation means any separately incorporated entity, whether or not affiliated.\n\n(m) Reporting. When the aggregate costs under this section exceed $2,000 per election, all costs of the communication(s) shall be reported on the filing dates specified in 11 CFR 104.6, and shall include the total amount expended for each candidate supported.\n\n[67 FR 50585, Aug. 5, 2002, as amended at 79 FR 16663, Mar. 26, 2014]",

    "content": "(a) General provisions. Repayment of a loan of money to a candidate or a political committee by a State bank, a federally chartered depository institution (including a national bank) or a depository institution whose deposits and accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Administration is not an expenditure by the lending institution if such loan is made in accordance with applicable banking laws and regulations and is made in the ordinary course of business. A loan will be deemed to be made in the ordinary course of business if it:\n\n(1) Bears the usual and customary interest rate of the lending institution for the category of loan involved;\n\n(2) Is made on a basis that assures repayment;\n\n(3) Is evidenced by a written instrument; and\n\n(4) Is subject to a due date or amortization schedule.\n\n(b) Reporting. Such loans shall be reported by the political committee in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(a) and (d).\n\n(c) Endorsers and guarantors. Each endorser or guarantor shall be deemed to have contributed that portion of the total amount of the loan for which he or she agreed to be liable in a written agreement, except that, in the event of a signature by the candidate's spouse, the provisions of 11 CFR 100.52(b)(4) shall apply. Any reduction in the unpaid balance of the loan shall reduce proportionately the amount endorsed or guaranteed by each endorser or guarantor in such written agreement. In the event that the loan agreement does not stipulate the portion of the loan for which each endorser or guarantor is liable, the loan shall be considered an expenditure by each endorser or guarantor in the same proportion to the unpaid balance that each endorser or guarantor bears to the total number of endorsers or guarantors.\n\n(d) Overdrafts. For the purpose of this section, repayment of an overdraft made on a checking or savings account of a political committee shall be considered an expenditure unless:\n\n(1) The overdraft is made on an account that is subject to automatic overdraft protection; and\n\n(2) The overdraft is subject to a definite interest rate and a definite repayment schedule.\n\n(e) Made on a basis that assures repayment. A loan, including a line of credit, shall be considered made on a basis that assures repayment if it is obtained using either of the sources of repayment described in paragraphs (e)(1) or (2) of this section, or a combination of paragraphs (e)(1) or (2) of this section:\n\n(1)(i) The lending institution making the loan has perfected a security interest in collateral owned by the candidate or political committee receiving the loan; the fair market value of the collateral is equal to or greater than the loan amount and any senior liens as determined on the date of the loan; and the candidate or political committee provides records to show that the lending institution has a perfected security interest in the collateral. Sources of collateral include, but are not limited to, ownership in real estate, personal property, goods, negotiable instruments, certificates of deposit, chattel papers, stocks, accounts receivable and cash on deposit.\n\n(ii) Amounts guaranteed by secondary sources of repayment, such as guarantors and cosigners, shall not exceed the contribution limits of 11 CFR part 110 or contravene the prohibitions of 11 CFR 110.4, 110.20, part 114 and part 115; or\n\n(2) The lending institution making the loan has obtained a written agreement whereby the candidate or political committee receiving the loan has pledged future receipts, such as public financing payments under 11 CFR part 9001 through part 9012 or part 9031 through 9039, contributions, or interest income, provided that:\n\n(i) The amount of the loan(s) obtained the basis of such funds does not exceed the amount of pledged funds;\n\n(ii) Loan amounts are based on a reasonable expectation of the receipt of pledged funds. To that end, the candidate or political committee must furnish the lending institution records, i.e., cash flow charts or other financial plans, that reasonably establish that such future funds will be available;\n\n(iii) A separate depository account is established at the lending institution or the lender obtains an assignment from the candidate or political committee to access funds in a committee account at another depository institution that meets the requirements of 11 CFR 103.2, and the committee has notified the other institution of this assignment;\n\n(iv) The loan agreement requires the deposit of the public financing payments, contributions, interest or other income pledged as collateral into the separate depository account for the purpose of retiring the debt according to the repayment requirements of the loan; and\n\n(v) In the case of public financing payments, the borrower authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to directly deposit the payments into the depository account for the purpose of retiring the debt.\n\n(3) If the requirements set forth in paragraph (e) of this section are not met, the Commission will consider the totality of circumstances on a case-by-case basis in determining whether a loan was made on a basis that assures repayment.\n\n(f) This section shall not apply to loans described in 11 CFR 100.83 and 100.143.\n\n[67 FR 50585, Aug. 5, 2002, as amended at 67 FR 78680, Dec. 26, 2002; 89 FR 215, Jan. 2, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) Transfers of funds; registration and reporting required—(1) Who may make transfers under this section. (i) Transfers of funds may be made without limit on amount between affiliated committees whether or not they are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5.\n\n(ii) Subject to the restrictions set forth at 11 CFR 300.10(a), 300.31 and 300.34(a) and (b), transfers of funds may be made without limit on amount between or among a national party committee, a State party committee and/or any subordinate party committee whether or not they are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5 and whether or not such committees are affiliated.\n\n(iii) Transfers of joint fundraising proceeds may be made without limit on amount between organizations or committees participating in the joint fundraising activity provided that no participating committee or organization governed by 11 CFR 102.17 received more than its allocated share of the funds raised.\n\n(iv) Transfers under paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iii) shall be made only from funds which are permissible under the Act. See 11 CFR parts 110, 114 and 115.\n\n(2) When registration and reporting required. Except as provided in 11 CFR 102.6(b), organizations or committees making transfers under 11 CFR 102.6(a)(1) shall count such transfers against the reporting thresholds of the Act for determining whether an organization or committee is a political committee under 11 CFR 100.5.\n\n(b) Fundraising by collecting agents; No reporting required—(1) Definition of collecting agent. A collecting agent is an organization or committee that collects and transmits contributions to one or more separate segregated funds to which the collecting agent is related. A collecting agent may be either:\n\n(i) A committee, whether or not it is a political committee as defined in 11 CFR 100.5, affiliated with the separate segregated fund under 11 CFR 110.3; or\n\n(ii) The connected organization of the separate segregated fund as defined in 11 CFR 100.6; or\n\n(iii) A parent, subsidiary, branch, division, department, or local unit of the connected organization of the separate segregated fund; or\n\n(iv) A local, national or international union collecting contributions on behalf of the separate segregated fund of any federation with which the local, national or international union is affiliated. See 11 CFR 114.1(e).\n\n(2) Collecting agent not required to report. A collecting agent that is an unregistered organization and that follows the procedures of 11 CFR 102.6(c) is not required to register and report as a political committee under 11 CFR parts 102 and 104, provided that the organization does not engage in other activities such as making contributions or expenditures for the purpose of influencing federal elections.\n\n(3) Who is not a collecting agent—(i) Commercial fundraising firm. A separate segregated fund or a collecting agent may hire a commercial fundraising firm to assist in fundraising; however, the commercial fundraising firm shall not be considered as a collecting agent for the purpose of this section. Rather, the commercial fundraising firm shall be considered to be the agent of the separate segregated fund or collecting agent.\n\n(ii) Individuals. An individual who collects contributions for a separate segregated fund shall not be considered a collecting agent for the purpose of this section. Individuals who collect contributions are subject to the requirements of 11 CFR 102.8 and the provisions of 11 CFR part 110.\n\n(4) Separate segregated fund may collect contributions. Nothing in this section shall preclude a separate segregated fund from soliciting and collecting contributions on its own behalf.\n\n(c) Procedures for collecting agents—(1) Separate segregated fund responsible for acts of collecting agent. The separate segregated fund shall be responsible for ensuring that the recordkeeping, reporting and transmittal requirements of this section are met.\n\n(2) Solicitation for contributions. A collecting agent may include a solicitation for voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund with a bill for membership dues or other payments such as conference registration fees or a solicitation for contributions to the collecting agent. The collecting agent may only solicit contributions from those persons permitted to be solicited under 11 CFR part 114. The solicitation for contributions must meet all of the requirements for proper solicitations under 11 CFR 114.5.\n\n(i) The collecting agent may pay any or all of the costs incurred in soliciting and transmitting contributions to the separate segregated fund.\n\n(ii) If the separate segregated fund pays any solicitation or other administrative expense from its own account, which expense could be paid for as an administrative expense by the collecting agent, the collecting agent may reimburse the separate segregated fund no later than 30 calendar days after the expense was paid by the separate segregated fund.\n\n(3) Combining contributions with other payments. A contributor may write a check or authorize a credit card or electronic payment that represents both a contribution and payment of dues or other fees. The combined payment must be made from the contributor's personal account or on a non-repayable corporate drawing account of the individual contributor. Under a payroll deduction plan, an employer may make a payment on behalf of its employees to a union or its agent that represents a combined payment of voluntary contributions to the union's separate segregated fund and union dues or other employee deductions.\n\n(4) Transmittal of contributions. The full amount of each contribution collected by a collecting agent on behalf of a separate segregated fund shall be transmitted to that fund within 10 or 30 days as required by 11 CFR 102.8.\n\n(i) Checks made payable to the separate segregated fund shall be transmitted by the collecting agent directly to the separate segregated fund in accordance with 11 CFR 102.8.\n\n(ii) To transfer all other contributions, a collecting agent shall either:\n\n(A) Establish a transmittal account to be used solely for the deposit and transmittal of funds collected on behalf of the separate segregated fund. Funds deposited into this account are subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the Act. If any expenditure is made from the account, other than a transfer of funds to an affiliated committee, the account shall be considered a depository of the recipient committee and all activity of that account shall be reported; or\n\n(B) Deposit the contributions collected into the collecting agent's treasury account. The collecting agent shall keep separate records of all receipts and deposits that represent contributions to the separate segregated fund and, in the case of cash contributions, the collecting agent shall make separate deposits of such funds; or\n\n(C) Deposit the contributions collected into an account otherwise established solely for State or local election activity. The collecting agent shall keep separate records of all receipts and deposits that represent contributions to the separate segregated fund; or\n\n(D) In the case of cash contributions, transmit the contributions to the separate segregated fund in the form of money orders or cashier's checks.\n\n(5) Contributor information. The collecting agent shall comply with the requirements of 11 CFR 102.8 regarding transmittal of contributions and contributor information to the separate segregated fund, except that if contributions of $50 or less are received at a mass collection, a record shall be kept of the date, the total amount collected, and the name of the function at which the collection was made.\n\n(6) Retention of records. The collecting agent shall retain all records of contribution deposits and transmittals under this section for a period of three years and shall make these records available to the Commission on request. The separate segregated fund shall keep a record of all transmittals of contributions received from collecting agents under this section, and shall retain these records for a period of three years.\n\n(7) Reporting of funds received through collecting agents. A separate segregated fund receiving contributions collected by a collecting agent shall report the full amount of each contribution received as a contribution from the original contributor to the extent required by 11 CFR 104.3(a).\n\n[48 FR 26300, June 7, 1983, as amended at 68 FR 451, Jan. 3, 2003; 69 FR 63920, Nov. 3, 2004; 89 FR 215, Jan. 2, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. Nothing in this section shall supersede 11 CFR part 300, which prohibits any person from soliciting, receiving, directing, transferring, or spending any non-Federal funds, or from transferring Federal funds for Federal election activities.\n\n(1)(i) Political committees may engage in joint fundraising with other political committees or with unregistered committees or organizations. The participants in a joint fundraising effort under this section shall either establish a separate committee or select a participating committee, to act as fundraising representative for all participants. The fundraising representative shall be a reporting political committee and an authorized committee of each candidate for federal office participating in the joint fundraising activity. If the participants establish a separate committee to act as the fundraising representative, the separate committee shall not be a participant in any other joint fundraising effort, but the separate committee may conduct more than one joint fundraising effort for the participants.\n\n(ii) The participants may hire a commercial fundraising firm or other agent to assist in conducting the joint fundraising activity. In that case, however, the fundraising representative shall still be responsible for ensuring that the recordkeeping and reporting requirements set forth in this section are met.\n\n(2) The procedures in 11 CFR 102.17(c) will govern all joint fundraising activity conducted under this section. The participants in joint fundraising activity may include political party committees (whether or not they are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5), candidate committees, multicandidate committees, and unregistered organizations which do not qualify as collecting agents under 11 CFR 102.6(b).\n\n(3) A fundraising representative conducting joint fundraising under this section is distinguished from an unregistered organization acting as a collecting agent under 11 CFR 102.6(b). If a separate segregated fund or an unregistered organization qualifies and acts as a collecting agent under 11 CFR 102.6(b), the provisions of 11 CFR 102.17 will not apply to that fundraising activity.\n\n(b) Fundraising representatives—(1) Separate fundraising committee as fundraising representative. Participating committees may establish a separate political committee to act as fundraising representative for all participants. This separate committee shall be a reporting political committee and shall collect contributions, pay fundraising costs from gross proceeds and from funds advanced by participants, and disburse net proceeds to each participant.\n\n(2) Participating committee as fundraising representative. All participating committees may select one participant to act as fundraising representative for all participants. The fundraising representative must be a political committee as defined in 11 CFR 100.5. The fundraising representative and any other participating committees may collect contributions; however, all contributions received by other participants shall be forwarded to the fundraising representative as required by 11 CFR 102.8. The fundraising representative shall pay fundraising costs from gross proceeds and from funds advanced by participants and shall disburse net proceeds to each participant.\n\n(3) Funds advanced for fundraising costs. (i) Except as provided in 11 CFR 102.17(b) (3)(ii) and (iii), the amount of funds advanced by each participant for fundraising costs shall be in proportion to the allocation formula agreed upon under 11 CFR 102.17 (c)(1).\n\n(ii) A participant may advance more than its proportionate share of the fundraising costs, however, the amount advanced which is in excess of the participant's proportionate share shall not exceed the amount that participant could legally contribute to the remaining participants. See 11 CFR 102.12(c)(2) and part 110.\n\n(iii) If all the participants are affiliated under 11 CFR 110.3 or if the participants are all party committees of the same political party, there is no limit on the amount a participant may advance for fundraising costs on behalf of the other participants.\n\n(c) Joint fundraising procedures. The requirements of 11 CFR 102.17(c)(1) through (8) shall govern joint fundraising activity conducted under this section.\n\n(1) Written agreement. The participants in a joint fundraising activity shall enter into a written agreement, whether or not all participants are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5. The written agreement shall identify the fundraising representative and shall state a formula for the allocation of fundraising proceeds. The formula shall be stated as the amount or percentage of each contribution received to be allocated to each participant. The fundraising representative shall retain the written agreement for a period of three years and shall make it available to the Commission on request.\n\n(2) Fundraising notice. In addition to any notice required under 11 CFR 110.11, a joint fundraising notice shall be included with every solicitation for contributions.\n\n(i) This notice shall include the following information:\n\n(A) The names of all committees participating in the joint fundraising activity whether or not such committees are political committees under 11 CFR 100.5; and\n\n(B) The allocation formula to be used for distributing joint fundraising proceeds; and\n\n(C) A statement informing contributors that, notwithstanding the stated allocation formula, they may designate their contributions for a particular participant or participants; and\n\n(D) A statement informing contributors that the allocation formula may change if a contributor makes a contribution which would exceed the amount that contributor may give to any participant.\n\n(ii) In the following situations, the notice shall include the following additional information:\n\n(A) If one or more participants engage in the joint fundraising activity solely to satisfy outstanding debts, a statement informing contributors that the allocation formula may change if a participant receives sufficient funds to pay its outstanding debts; and\n\n(B) If one or more participants can lawfully accept contributions that are prohibited under the Act, a statement informing contributors that contributions from prohibited sources will be distributed only to those participants that can accept them.\n\n(3) Separate depository account. (i) The participants or the fundraising representative shall establish a separate depository account to be used solely for the receipt and disbursement of the joint fundraising proceeds. All contributions deposited into the separate depository account must be permissible under the Act. Each political committee shall amend its Statement of Organization to reflect the account as an additional depository. If one or more participants can lawfully accept contributions that are prohibited under the Act, the participants may either establish a second depository account for contributions received from prohibited sources or they may forward such contributions directly to the nonfederal participants.\n\n(ii) The fundraising representative shall deposit all joint fundraising proceeds in the separate depository account within ten days of receipt as required by 11 CFR 103.3. The fundraising representative may delay distribution of the fundraising proceeds to the participants until all contributions are received and all expenses are paid.\n\n(iii) For contribution reporting and limitation purposes, the date of receipt of a contribution by a participating political committee is the date that the contribution is received by the fundraising representative. The fundraising representative shall report contributions in the reporting period in which they are received. Participating political committees shall report joint fundraising proceeds in accordance with 11 CFR 102.17(c)(8) when such funds are received from the fundraising representative.\n\n(4) Recordkeeping requirements. (i) The fundraising representative and participating committees shall screen all contributions received to insure that the prohibitions and limitations of 11 CFR parts 110 and 114 are observed. Participating political committees shall make their contributor records available to the fundraising representative to enable the fundraising representative to carry out its duty to screen contributions.\n\n(ii) The fundraising representative shall collect and retain contributor information with regard to gross proceeds as required under 11 CFR 102.8 and shall also forward such information to participating political committees. The fundraising representative shall also keep a record of the total amount of contributions received from prohibited sources, if any, and of all transfers of prohibited contributions to participants that can accept them.\n\n(iii) The fundraising representative shall retain the records required under 11 CFR 102.9 regarding fundraising disbursements for a period of three years. Commercial fundraising firms or agents shall forward such information to the fundraising representative.\n\n(5) Contribution limitations. Except to the extent that the contributor has previously contributed to any of the participants, a contributor may make a contribution to the joint fundraising effort which contribution represents the total amount that the contributor could contribute to all of the participants under the applicable limits of 11 CFR 110.1 and 110.2.\n\n(6) Allocation of gross proceeds. (i) The fundraising representative shall allocate proceeds according to the formula stated in the fundraising agreement. If distribution according to the allocation formula extinguishes the debts of one or more participants and results in a surplus for those participants or if distribution under the formula results in a violation of the contribution limits of 11 CFR 110.1(a), the fundraising representative may reallocate the excess funds. Reallocation shall be based upon the remaining participants' proportionate shares under the allocation formula. If reallocation results in a violation of a contributor's limit under 11 CFR 110.1, the fundraising representative shall return to the contributor the amount of the contribution that exceeds the limit.\n\n(ii) Designated contributions which exceed the contributor's limit to the designated participant under 11 CFR part 110 may not be reallocated by the fundraising representative absent the prior written permission of the contributor.\n\n(iii) If any participants can lawfully accept contributions from sources prohibited under the Act, any such contributions that are received are not required to be distributed according to the allocation formula.\n\n(7) Allocation of expenses and distribution of net proceeds. (i) If participating committees are not affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity and are not committees of the same political party;\n\n(A) After gross contributions are allocated among the participants under 11 CFR 102.17(c)(6), the fundraising representative shall calculate each participant's share of expenses based on the percentage of the total receipts each participant had been allocated. If contributions from sources prohibited under the Act have been received and distributed under 11 CFR 102.17(c)(6)(iii), those contributions need not be included in the total receipts for the purpose of allocating expenses under this section. To calculate each participant's net proceeds, the fundraising representative shall subtract the participant's share of expenses from the amount that participant has been allocated from gross proceeds.\n\n(B) A participant may only pay expenses on behalf of another participant subject to the contribution limits of 11 CFR part 110.\n\n(C) The expenses from a series of fundraising events or activities shall be allocated among the participants on a per-event basis regardless of whether the participants change or remain the same throughout the series.\n\n(ii) If participating committees are affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity or if participants are party committees of the same political party, expenses need not be allocated among those participants. Payment of such expenses by an unregistered committee or organization on behalf of an affiliated political committee may cause the unregistered organization to become a political committee.\n\n(iii) Payment of expenses may be made from gross proceeds by the fundraising representative.\n\n(8) Reporting of receipts and disbursements—(i) Reporting receipts. (A) The fundraising representative shall report all funds received in the reporting period in which they are received. The fundraising representative shall report the total amount of contributions received from prohibited sources during the reporting period, if any, as a memo entry. Each Schedule A filed by the fundraising representative under this section shall clearly indicate that the contributions reported on that schedule represent joint fundraising proceeds.\n\n(B) After distribution of net proceeds, each participating political committee shall report its share of net proceeds received as a transfer-in from the fundraising representative. Each participating political committee shall also file a memo Schedule A itemizing its share of gross receipts as contributions from original contributors to the extent required under 11 CFR 104.3(a).\n\n(ii) Reporting disbursements. The fundraising representative shall report all disbursements in the reporting period in which they are made.\n\n[48 FR 26301, June 7, 1983, as amended at 56 FR 35909, July 29, 1991; 67 FR 49112, July 29, 2002]",

However, statements or descriptions such as advance, election day expenses, other expenses, expenses, expense reimbursement, miscellaneous, outside services, get-out-the-vote and voter registration would not meet the requirements of 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3) for reporting the purpose of an expenditure.\n\n(ii) Each affiliated committee to which a transfer is made by the reporting committee during the reporting period and, where the reporting committee is a political party committee, each transfer of funds by the reporting committee to another political party committee, regardless of whether such committees are affiliated, together with the date and amount of such transfer;\n\n(iii) Each person who receives a loan repayment from the reporting committee during the reporting period, together with the date and amount of such loan repayment;\n\n(iv) Each person who receives a contribution refund or other offset to contributions from the reporting committee where such contribution refund was reported under 11 CFR 104.3(b)(1)(iv), together with the date and amount of such refund or offset;\n\n(v) Each political committee which has received a contribution from the reporting committee during the reporting period, together with the date and amount of any such contribution, and, in the case of a contribution to an authorized committee, the candidate's name and office sought (including State and Congressional district, if applicable);\n\n(vi) Each person who has received a loan from the reporting committee during the reporting period, together with the date and amount or value of such loan;\n\n(vii)(A) Each person who receives any disbursement during the reporting period in an aggregate amount or value in excess of $200 within the calendar year in connection with an independent expenditure by the reporting committee, together with the date, amount, and purpose of any such independent expenditure(s);\n\n(B) For each independent expenditure reported, the committee must also provide a statement which indicates whether such independent expenditure is in support of, or in opposition to a particular candidate, as well as the name of the candidate and the office sought by such candidate (including State and Congressional district, when applicable), and a certification, under penalty of perjury, as to whether such independent expenditure is made in cooperation, consultation or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, any candidate or authorized committee or agent of such committee; and\n\n(C) For an independent expenditure that is made in support of or opposition to a presidential primary candidate and is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in six or more states but does not refer to any particular state, the political committee must report the independent expenditure as a single expenditure—i.e., without allocating it among states—and must indicate the state with the next upcoming presidential primary among those states where the independent expenditure is distributed, as specified in § 104.4(f)(2).

Each authorized committee shall report the full name and address of each person in each of the following categories, as well as the information required by each category.\n\n(i) Each person to whom an expenditure in an aggregate amount or value in excess of $200 within the election cycle is made by the reporting authorized committee to meet the authorized committee's operating expenses, together with the date, amount and purpose of each expenditure.\n\n(A) As used in this paragraph, purpose means a brief statement or description of why the disbursement was made. Examples of statements or descriptions which meet the requirements of this paragraph include the following: dinner expenses, media, salary, polling, travel, party fees, phone banks, travel expenses, travel expense reimbursement, and catering costs. However, statements or descriptions such as advance, election day expenses, other expenses, expenses, expense reimbursement, miscellaneous, outside services, get-out-the-vote and voter registration would not meet the requirements of this paragraph for reporting the purpose of an expenditure.\n\n(B) In addition to reporting the purpose described in paragraph (b)(4)(i)(A) of this section, whenever an authorized committee itemizes a disbursement that is partially or entirely a personal use for which reimbursement is required under 11 CFR 113.1(g)(1)(ii)(C) or (D), it shall provide a brief explanation of the activity for which reimbursement is required.\n\n(ii) Each authorized committee of the same candidate to which a transfer is made by the reporting committee during the reporting period, together with the date and amount of such transfer;\n\n(iii) Each person who receives a loan repayment, including a repayment of a loan of money derived from an advance on a candidate's brokerage account, credit card, home equity line of credit, or other lines of credit described in 11 CFR 100.83 and 100.143, from the reporting committee during the reporting period, together with the date and amount of such loan repayment;\n\n(iv) [Reserved]\n\n(v) Each person who receives a contribution refund or other offset to contributions from the reporting committee where such contribution refund was reported under 11 CFR 104.3(b)(2)(v), together with the date and amount of such refund or offset.\n\n(vi) Each person who has received any disbursement(s) not otherwise disclosed under paragraph (b)(4) of this section to whom the aggregate amount or value of such disbursements exceeds $200 within the election cycle, together with the date, amount, and purpose of any such disbursement.\n\n(c) Summary of contributions and operating expenditures.

Each report filed under 11 CFR 104.1 shall, on Schedule C or D, as appropriate, disclose the amount and nature of outstanding debts and obligations owed by or to the reporting committee. Loans, including a loan of money derived from an advance on a candidate's brokerage account, credit card, home equity line of credit, or other lines of credit described in 11 CFR 100.83, obtained by an individual prior to becoming a candidate for use in connection with that individual's campaign shall be reported as an outstanding loan owed to the lender by the candidate's principal campaign committee, if such loans are outstanding at the time the individual becomes a candidate.

This paragraph (d)(2) shall not apply to any Schedule C-1 or C-P-1 that is filed pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section.\n\n(3) The political committee shall file in the next due report a Schedule C-1 or C-P-1 each time a draw is made on a line of credit, and each time a loan or line of credit is restructured to change the terms of repayment. This paragraph (d)(3) shall not apply to any Schedule C-1 or C-P-1 that is filed pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section.\n\n(4) When a candidate obtains a bank loan or loan of money derived from an advance on the candidate's brokerage account, credit card, home equity line of credit, or other line of credit described in 11 CFR 100.83 and 100.143 for use in connection with the candidate's campaign, the candidate's principal campaign committee shall disclose in the report covering the period when the loan was obtained, the following information on Schedule C-1 or C-P-1:\n\n(i) The date, amount, and interest rate of the loan, advance, or line of credit;\n\n(ii) The name and address of the lending institution; and\n\n(iii) The types and value of collateral or other sources of repayment that secure the loan, advance, or line of credit, if any.\n\n(e) Use of pseudonyms. (1) To determine whether the names and addresses of its contributors are being used in violation of 11 CFR 104.15 to solicit contributions or for commercial purposes, a political committee may submit up to ten (10) pseudonyms on each report filed.\n\n(2) For purposes of this section, a pseudonym is a wholly fictitious name which does not represent the name of an actual contributor to a committee.\n\n(3) If a committee uses pseudonyms it shall subtract the total dollar amount of the fictitious contributions from the total amount listed as a memo entry on line 11(a) of the Detailed Summary page, Unitemized contributions from individual persons other than political committees. Thus, the committee will, for this purpose only, be overstating the amount of itemized contributions received and understating the amount of unitemized contributions received.\n\n(4) No authorized committee of a candidate shall attribute more than $1,000 in contributions to the same pseudonym for each election and no other political committee shall attribute more than $5,000 in contributions to the same pseudonym in any calendar year.\n\n(5) A committee using pseudonyms shall send a list of such pseudonyms under separate cover directly to the Reports Analysis Division, Federal Election Commission, on or before the date on which any report containing such pseudonyms is filed with the Commission. The Commission shall maintain the list, but shall exclude it from the public record. A committee shall not send any list of pseudonyms to any Secretary of State or equivalent state officer.\n\n(6) A political committee shall not use pseudonyms for the purpose of circumventing the reporting requirements or the limitations and prohibitions of the Act.\n\n(f) Consolidated reports. Each principal campaign committee shall consolidate in each report those reports required to be filed with it. Such consolidated reports shall include:\n\n(1) Reports submitted to it by any authorized committees; and\n\n(2) The principal campaign committee's own reports.\n\n(g) Building funds. (1) A political party committee must report gifts, subscriptions, loans, advances, deposits of money, or anything of value that are used by the political party committee's Federal accounts to defray the costs of construction or purchase of the committee's office building. See 11 CFR 300.35. Such a receipt is a contribution subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the Act and reportable as a contribution, regardless of whether the contributor has designated the funds or things of value for such purpose and regardless of whether such funds are deposited in a separate Federal account dedicated to that purpose.\n\n(2) Gifts, subscriptions, loans, advances, deposits of money, or anything of value that are donated to a non-Federal account of a State or local party committee and are used by that party committee for the purchase or construction of its office building are not contributions subject to the reporting requirements of the Act. The reporting of such funds or things of value is subject to State law.\n\n(3) Gifts, subscriptions, loans, advances, deposits of money, or anything of value that are used by a national committee of a political party to defray the costs of construction or purchase of the national committee's office building are contributions subject to the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section.\n\n(h) Legal and accounting services. A committee which receives legal or accounting services pursuant to 11 CFR 100.85 and 100.86 shall report as a memo entry, on Schedule A, the amounts paid for these services by the regular employer of the person(s) providing such services; the date(s) such services were performed; and the name of each person performing such services.\n\n(i) Cumulative reports. The reports required to be filed under § 104.5 shall be cumulative for the calendar year (or for the election cycle, in the case of an authorized committee) to which they relate, but if there has been no change in a category reported in a previous report during that year (or during that election cycle, in the case of an authorized committee), only the amount thereof need be carried forward.\n\n(j) Earmarked contributions. Earmarked contributions shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 110.6. See also 11 CFR 102.8(c).\n\n(k) Reporting Election Cycle Activity Occurring Prior to January 1, 2001. The aggregate of each category of receipt listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, except those in paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, and for each category of disbursement listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall include amounts received or disbursed on or after the day after the last general election for the seat or office for which the candidate is running through December 31, 2000.\n\n[45 FR 15108, Mar. 7, 1980]",

    "content": "(a) Regularly scheduled reporting. Every political committee that makes independent expenditures must report all such independent expenditures on Schedule E in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(vii). Every person that is not a political committee must report independent expenditures in accordance with paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section and 11 CFR 109.10.\n\n(b) Reports of independent expenditures made at any time up to and including the 20th day before an election—(1) Independent expenditures aggregating less than $10,000 in a calendar year. For each election in which a political committee makes independent expenditures, the political committee shall aggregate its independent expenditures made in each calendar year to determine its reporting obligation. When a committee makes independent expenditures aggregating less than $10,000 for an election in any calendar year, up to and including the 20th day before an election, the committee must report those independent expenditures on Schedule E of the applicable FEC Form, at the time of its regular reports in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3, 104.5, and 104.9.\n\n(2) Independent expenditures aggregating $10,000 or more in a calendar year. For each election in which a political committee makes independent expenditures, the political committee shall aggregate its independent expenditures made in each calendar year to determine its reporting obligation. When a committee makes independent expenditures aggregating $10,000 or more for an election in any calendar year, up to and including the 20th day before an election, it must report those independent expenditures on Schedule E of the applicable FEC Form. Political committees must ensure that the Commission receives these reports by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard/Daylight Time on the second day following the date on which a communication that constitutes an independent expenditure is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. Each time subsequent independent expenditures relating to the same election aggregate an additional $10,000 or more, the political committee must ensure that the Commission receives a new 48-hour report of the subsequent independent expenditures by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard/Daylight Time on the second day following the date on which the communication is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. (See paragraph (f) of this section for aggregation.) Each 48-hour report must contain the information required by 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(vii) indicating whether the independent expenditure is made in support of, or in opposition to, the candidate involved. In addition to other permissible means of filing, a political committee may file the 48-hour reports under this section by any of the means permissible under 11 CFR 100.19(d)(3).\n\n(c) Reports of independent expenditures made less than 20 days, but more than 24 hours before the day of an election. Political committees must ensure that the Commission receives reports of independent expenditures aggregating $1,000 or more with respect to a given election, after the 20th day, but more than 24 hours before 12:01 a.m. of the day of the election, by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard/Daylight Time on the day following the date on which a communication is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. Each time subsequent independent expenditures relating to the same election aggregate an additional $1,000 or more, the political committee must ensure that the Commission receives a new 24-hour report of the subsequent independent expenditures by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard/Daylight Time on the day following the date on which a communication that constitutes an independent expenditure is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated. (See paragraph (f) of this section for aggregation.) Each 24-hour report shall contain the information required by 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(vii) indicating whether the independent expenditure is made in support of, or in opposition to, the candidate involved. Political committees may file reports under this section by any of the means permissible under 11 CFR 100.19(d)(3).\n\n(d) Verification. Political committees must verify reports of independent expenditures filed under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section by one of the methods stated in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section. Any report verified under either of these methods shall be treated for all purposes (including penalties for perjury) in the same manner as a document verified by signature.\n\n(1) For reports filed on paper (e.g., by hand-delivery, U.S. Mail or facsimile machine), the treasurer of the political committee that made the independent expenditure must certify, under penalty of perjury, the independence of the expenditure by handwritten signature immediately following the certification required by 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(vii).\n\n(2) For reports filed by electronic mail, the treasurer of the political committee that made the independent expenditure shall certify, under penalty of perjury, the independence of the expenditure by electronic signature immediately following the certification required by 11 CFR 104.3(b)(3)(vii).\n\n(e) Where to file.

Such a computer printout or screen capture shall constitute conclusive evidence that the reporting committee has consulted such websites and not found the name of the person sought, but shall not be the exclusive means by which the reporting committee may provide evidence that it has consulted such websites and not found the name of the person sought.\n\n(iii) A reporting committee shall be subject to the reporting requirement under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if it had actual knowledge that, at the time a contribution was forwarded or received, the person whose name is sought was required to be listed on any registration or report described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.\n\n(c) Lobbyist/Registrant PAC reporting requirements.

    "content": "(a) General rule. (1) Expenditures, including in-kind contributions, independent expenditures, and coordinated expenditures made on behalf of more than one clearly identified Federal candidate shall be attributed to each such candidate according to the benefit reasonably expected to be derived. For example, in the case of a publication or broadcast communication, the attribution shall be determined by the proportion of space or time devoted to each candidate as compared to the total space or time devoted to all candidates. In the case of a fundraising program or event where funds are collected by one committee for more than one clearly identified candidate, the attribution shall be determined by the proportion of funds received by each candidate as compared to the total receipts by all candidates. In the case of a phone bank, the attribution shall be determined by the number of questions or statements devoted to each candidate as compared to the total number of questions or statements devoted to all candidates. These methods shall also be used to allocate payments involving both expenditures on behalf of one or more clearly identified Federal candidates and disbursements on behalf of one or more clearly identified non-Federal candidates.\n\n(2) An expenditure made on behalf of more than one clearly identified Federal candidate shall be reported pursuant to 11 CFR 104.10(a) or 104.17(a), as appropriate. A payment that also includes amounts attributable to one or more non-Federal candidates, and that is made by a political committee with separate Federal and non-Federal accounts, shall be made according to the procedures set forth in 11 CFR 106.6(e) or 106.7(f), but shall be reported pursuant to 11 CFR 104.10(a) or 104.17(a). If a State, district, or local party committee's payment on behalf of both a Federal candidate and a non-Federal candidate is for a Federal election activity, only Federal funds may be used for the entire payment. For Federal election activities, the provisions of 11 CFR 300.33 and 104.17(a) will apply to payments attributable to candidates.\n\n(b) An authorized expenditure made by a candidate or political committee on behalf of another candidate shall be reported as a contribution in-kind (transfer) to the candidate on whose behalf the expenditure was made, except that expenditures made by party committees pursuant to § 109.32 or 109.33 need only be reported as an expenditure.\n\n(c) Exceptions: (1) Expenditures for rent, personnel, overhead, general administrative, fund-raising, and other day-to-day costs of political committees need not be attributed to individual candidates, unless these expenditures are made on behalf of a clearly identified candidate and the expenditure can be directly attributed to that candidate.\n\n(2) Expenditures for educational campaign seminars, for training of campaign workers, and for registration or get-out-the-vote drives of committees need not be attributed to individual candidates unless these expenditures are made on behalf of a clearly identified candidate, and the expenditure can be directly attributed to that candidate.\n\n(3) Payments made for the cost of certain voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities conducted by State or local party organizations on behalf of any Presidential or Vice-Presidential candidate(s) are exempt from the definition of a contribution or an expenditure under 11 CFR 100.89 and 100.149. If the State or local party organization includes references to any candidate(s) seeking nomination or election to the House of Representatives or Senate of the United States the portion of the cost of such activities allocable to such candidate(s) shall be considered a contribution to or an expenditure on behalf of such candidate(s), unless such reference is incidental to the overall activity. If such reference is incidental to the overall activity, such costs shall not be considered a contribution to or expenditure on behalf of any candidate(s).\n\n(d) For purposes of this section, clearly identified shall have the same meaning as set forth at 11 CFR 100.17.\n\n(e) State, district, and local party committees, separate segregated funds, and nonconnected committees that make mixed Federal/non-Federal payments for activities other than an activity entailing an expenditure for a Federal candidate and disbursement for a non-Federal candidate, or that make mixed Federal/Levin fund payments, shall allocate those expenses in accordance with 11 CFR 106.6, 106.7, or 300.33, as appropriate.\n\n[41 FR 35944, Aug. 25, 1976, as amended at 45 FR 15117, Mar. 7, 1980; 45 FR 21209, Apr. 1, 1980; 55 FR 26069, June 26, 1990; 60 FR 35305, July 6, 1995; 67 FR 49115, July 29, 2002; 67 FR 78681, Dec. 26, 2002]",

    "content": "(a) General—(1) This section applies to Presidential primary candidates receiving or expecting to receive federal matching funds pursuant to 11 CFR parts 9031 et seq. The expenditures described in 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2) shall be allocated to a particular State if incurred by a candidate's authorized committee(s) for the purpose of influencing the nomination of that candidate for the office of President with respect to that State. An expenditure shall not necessarily be allocated to the State in which the expenditure is incurred or paid. In the event that the Commission disputes the candidate's allocation or claim of exemption for a particular expense, the candidate shall demonstrate, with supporting records, that his or her proposed method of allocation or claim of exemption was reasonable. Expenditures required to be allocated to the primary election under 11 CFR 9034.4(e) shall also be allocated to particular states in accordance with this section.\n\n(2) Disbursements made prior to the time an individual becomes a candidate for the purpose of determining whether that individual should become a candidate pursuant to 11 CFR 100.72(a) and 100.131(a), i.e., payments for testing the waters, shall be allocable expenditures under this section if the individual becomes a candidate.\n\n(b) Method of allocating expenditures among States—(1) General allocation method. Unless otherwise specified under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2), an expenditure described in 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2) and incurred by a candidate's authorized committee(s) for the purpose of influencing the nomination of that candidate in more than one State shall be allocated to each State on a reasonable and uniformly applied basis. The total amount allocated to a particular State may be reduced by the amount of exempt fundraising expenses for that State, as specified in 11 CFR 110.8(c)(2).\n\n(2) Specific allocation methods. Expenditures that fall within the categories listed below shall be allocated based on the following methods. The method used to allocate a category of expenditures shall be based on consistent data for each State to which an allocation is made.\n\n(i) Media expenditures—(A) Print media. Except for expenditures exempted under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(i) (E) and (F), allocation of expenditures for the publication and distribution of newspaper, magazine and other types of printed advertisements distributed in more than one State shall be made using relative circulation percentages in each State or an estimate thereof. For purposes of this section, allocation to a particular State will not be required if less than 3% of the total estimated readership of the publication is in that State.\n\n(B) Broadcast media. Except for expenditures exempted under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(i) (E) and (F), expenditures for radio, television and similar types of advertisements purchased in a particular media market that covers more than one State shall be allocated to each State in proportion to the estimated audience. This allocation of expenditures, shall be made using industry market data. If industry market data is not available, the committee shall obtain market data from the media carrier transmitting the advertisement(s).\n\n(C) Refunds for media expenditures. Refunds for broadcast time or advertisement space, purchased but not used, shall be credited to the States on the same basis as the original allocation.\n\n(D) Limits on allocation of media expenditures. No allocation of media expenditures shall be made to any State in which the primary election has already been held.\n\n(E) National advertising. Expenditures incurred for advertisements on national networks, national cable or in publications distributed nationwide need not be allocated to any State.\n\n(F) Media production costs. Expenditures incurred for production of media advertising, whether or not that advertising is used in more than one State, need not be allocated to any State.\n\n(G) Commissions. Expenditures for commissions, fees and other compensation for the purchase of broadcast or print media need not be allocated to any State.\n\n(ii) Expenditures for mass mailings and other campaign materials. Expenditures for mass mailings of more than 500 pieces to addresses in the same State, and expenditures for shipping campaign materials to a State, including pins, bumperstickers, handbills, brochures, posters and yardsigns, shall be allocated to that State. For purposes of this section, mass mailing includes newsletters and other materials in which the content of the materials is substantially identical. Records supporting the committee's allocations under this section shall include: For each mass mailing, records showing the total number of pieces mailed and the number mailed to each state or zip code; and, for other campaign materials acquired for use outside the State of purchase, records relating to any shipping costs incurred for transporting these items to each State.\n\n(iii) Overhead expenditures—(A) Overhead expenditures of State offices and other facilities. Except for expenditures exempted under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(iii)(C), overhead expenditures of committee offices whose activities are directed at a particular State, and the costs of other facilities used for office functions and campaign events, shall be allocated to that State. An amount that does not exceed 10% of office overhead expenditures for a particular State may be treated as exempt compliance expenses, and may be excluded from allocation to that State.\n\n(B) Overhead expenditures of regional offices. Except for expenditures exempted under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(iii)(C), overhead expenditures of a committee regional office or any committee office with responsibilities in two or more States shall be allocated to the State holding the next primary election, caucus or convention in the region. The committee shall maintain records to demonstrate that an office operated on a regional basis. These records should show, for example, the kinds of programs conducted from the office, the number and nature of contacts with other States in the region, and the amount of time devoted to regional programs by staff working in the regional office.\n\n(C) Overhead expenditures of national campaign headquarters. Expenditures incurred for administrative, staff, and overhead expenditures of the national campaign headquarters need not be allocated to any State, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.\n\n(D) Definition of overhead expenditures. For purposes of 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(iii), overhead expenditures include, but are not limited to, rent, utilities, equipment, furniture, supplies, internet service, and telephone service base charges. “Telephone service base charges” include any regular monthly charges for committee phone service, and charges for phone installation and intrastate phone calls other than charges related to a special program under 11 CFR 106.2(b)(2)(iv). Inter-state calls are not included in “telephone service base charges.” Overhead expenditures also include the costs of temporary offices established while the candidate is traveling in the State or in the final weeks before the primary election, as well as expenses paid by campaign staff and subsequently reimbursed by the committee, such as miscellaneous supplies, copying, printing and telephone expenses. See 11 CFR 116.5.\n\n(iv) Expenditures for special telephone programs. Expenditures for special telephone programs targeted at a particular State, including the costs of designing and operating the program, the costs of installing or renting telephone lines and equipment, toll charges, personnel costs, consultants' fees, related travel costs, and rental of office space, including a pro rata portion of national, regional or State office space used for such purposes, shall be allocated to that State based on the percentage of telephone calls made to that State. Special telephone programs include voter registration, get out the vote efforts, fundraising, and telemarketing efforts conducted on behalf of the candidate. A special telephone program is targeted at a particular State if 10% or more of the total telephone calls made each month are made to that State. Records supporting the committee's allocation of each special telephone program under this section shall include either the telephone bills showing the total number of calls made in that program and the number made to each State; or, a copy of the list used to make the calls, from which these numbers can be determined.\n\n(v) Public opinion poll expenditures. Expenditures incurred for the taking of a public opinion poll covering only one State shall be allocated to that State. Except for expenditures incurred in conducting a public opinion poll on a nationwide basis, expenditures incurred for the taking of a public opinion poll covering two or more States shall be allocated to those States based on the number of people interviewed in each State. Expenditures incurred for the taking of a public opinion poll include consultant's fees, travel costs and other expenses associated with designing and conducting the poll. Records supporting the committee's allocation under this section shall include records showing the total number of people contacted for each poll and the number contacted in each State.\n\n(3) National consulting fees. Expenditures for consultants' fees need not be allocated to any State if the fees are charged for consulting on national campaign strategy. Expenditures for consultants' fees charged for conducting special telephone programs and public opinion polls shall be allocated in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) (iv) and (v) of this section.\n\n(c) Reporting. All expenditures allocated under this section shall be reported on FEC Form 3P, page 3.\n\n(d) Recordkeeping. All assumptions and supporting calculations for allocations made under this section shall be documented and retained for Commission inspection. In addition to the records specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the treasurer shall retain records supporting the committee's allocations of expenditures to particular States and claims of exemption from allocation under this section. If the records supporting the allocation or claim of exemption are not retained, the expenditure shall be considered allocable and shall be allocated to the State holding the next primary election, caucus or convention after the expenditure is incurred.\n\n[56 FR 35909, July 29, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 31872, June 16, 1995; 67 FR 78681, Dec. 26, 2002; 89 FR 216, Jan. 2, 2024]",

In presidential election years, national party committees other than the Senate or House campaign committees shall allocate to their Federal accounts at least 65% each of their administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives.\n\n(ii) Non-presidential election years. In all years other than presidential election years, national party committees other than the Senate or House campaign committees shall allocate to their Federal accounts at least 60% each of their administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives.\n\n(c) Senate and House campaign committees of a national party; method and minimum Federal percentage for allocating administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives—(1) Method for allocating administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives. Subject to the minimum percentage set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, each Senate or House campaign committee of a national party shall allocate its administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to the funds expended method, described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) as follows:\n\n(i) Under this method, expenses shall be allocated based on the ratio of Federal expenditures to total Federal and non-Federal disbursements made by the committee during the two-year Federal election cycle. This ratio shall be estimated and reported at the beginning of each Federal election cycle, based upon the committee's Federal and non-Federal disbursements in a prior comparable Federal election cycle or upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its disbursements for the coming two years. In calculating its Federal expenditures, the committee shall include only amounts contributed to or otherwise spent on behalf of specific federal candidates. Calculation of total Federal and non-Federal disbursements shall also be limited to disbursements for specific candidates, and shall not include overhead or other generic costs.\n\n(ii) On each of its periodic reports, the committee shall adjust its allocation ratio to reconcile it with the ratio of actual Federal and non-Federal disbursements made, to date. If the non-Federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall transfer funds from its Federal to its non-Federal account, as necessary, to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio. The committee shall make note of any such adjustments and transfers on its periodic reports, submitted pursuant to 11 CFR 104.5.\n\n(2) Minimum Federal percentage for administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives. Regardless of the allocation ratio calculated under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each Senate or House campaign committee of a national party shall allocate to its Federal account at least 65% each of its administrative expenses and costs of generic voter drives each year. If the committee's own allocation calculation under paragraph (c)(1) of this section yields a Federal share greater than 65%, then the higher percentage shall be applied. If such calculation yields a Federal share lower than 65%, then the committee shall report its calculated ratio according to 11 CFR 104.10(b), and shall apply the required minimum Federal percentage.\n\n(3) Allocation of fundraising costs. Senate and House campaign committees shall allocate the costs of each combined Federal and non-Federal fundraising program or event according to paragraph (f) of this section, with no minimum percentages required.\n\n(d)-(e) [Reserved]\n\n(f) National party committees; method for allocating direct costs of fundraising. (1) If Federal and non-Federal funds are collected by one committee through a joint activity, that committee shall allocate its direct costs of fundraising, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, according to the funds received method. Under this method, the committee shall allocate its fundraising costs based on the ratio of funds received into its Federal account to its total receipts from each fundraising program or event. This ratio shall be estimated prior to each such program or event based upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its Federal and non-Federal revenue from that program or event, and shall be noted in the committee's report for the period in which the first disbursement for such program or event occurred, submitted pursuant 11 CFR 104.5. Any disbursements for fundraising costs made prior to the actual program or event shall be allocated according to this estimated ratio.\n\n(2) No later than the date 60 days after each fundraising program or event from which both Federal and non-Federal funds are collected, the committee shall adjust the allocation ratio for that program or event to reflect the actual ratio of funds received. If the non-Federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall transfer funds from its Federal to its non-Federal account, as necessary, to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio. If the Federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall make any transfers of funds from its non-federal to its federal account to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio within the 60-day time period established by this paragraph. The committee shall make note of any such adjustments and transfers in its report for any period in which a transfer was made, and shall also report the date of the fundraising program or event that serves as the basis for the transfer. In the case of a telemarketing or direct mail campaign, the date for purposes of this paragraph is the last day of the telemarketing campaign, or the day on which the final direct mail solicitations are mailed.\n\n(g) Payment of allocable expenses by committees with separate Federal and non-Federal accounts—(1) Payment options. Committees that have established separate Federal and non-Federal accounts under 11 CFR 102.5(a)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(i) shall pay the expenses of joint Federal and non-Federal activities described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section according to either paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (ii), as follows:\n\n(i) Payment by Federal account; transfers from non-Federal account to Federal account. The committee shall pay the entire amount of an allocable expense from its Federal account and shall transfer funds from its non-Federal account to its Federal account solely to cover the non-Federal share of that allocable expense.\n\n(ii) Payment by separate allocation account; transfers from Federal and non-Federal accounts to allocation account. (A) The committee shall establish a separate allocation account into which funds from its Federal and non-Federal accounts shall be deposited solely for the purpose of paying the allocable expenses of joint Federal and non-Federal activities. Once a committee has established a separate allocation account for this purpose, all allocable expenses shall be paid from that account for as long as the account is maintained.\n\n(B) The committee shall transfer funds from its Federal and non-Federal accounts to its allocation account in amounts proportionate to the Federal or non-Federal share of each allocable expense.\n\n(C) No funds contained in the allocation account may be transferred to any other account maintained by the committee.\n\n(2) Timing of transfers between accounts. (i) Under either payment option described in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, the committee shall transfer funds from its non-Federal account to its Federal account or from its Federal and non-Federal accounts to its separate allocation account following determination of the final cost of each joint Federal and non-Federal activity, or in advance of such determination if advance payment is required by the vendor and if such payment is based on a reasonable estimate of the activity's final cost as determined by the committee and the vendor(s) involved.\n\n(ii) Funds transferred from a committee's non-Federal account to its Federal account or its allocation account are subject to the following requirements:\n\n(A) For each such transfer, the committee must itemize in its reports the allocable activities for which the transferred funds are intended to pay, as required by 11 CFR 104.10(b)(3); and\n\n(B) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, such funds may not be transferred more than 10 days before or more than 60 days after the payments for which they are designated are made.\n\n(iii) Any portion of a transfer from a committee's non-Federal account to its Federal account or its allocation account that does not meet the requirements of paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section shall be presumed to be a loan or contribution from the non-Federal account to a Federal account, in violation of the Act.\n\n(3) Reporting transfers of funds and allocated disbursements. A political committee that transfers funds between accounts and pays allocable expenses according to this section shall report each such transfer and disbursement pursuant to 11 CFR 104.10(b).\n\n(h) Sunset provision. This section applies from November 6, 2002, to December 31, 2002. After December 31, 2002, see 11 CFR 106.7(a).\n\n[67 FR 49116, July 29, 2002]",

For purposes of this section, “nonconnected committee” includes any committee which conducts activities in connection with an election, but which is not a party committee, an authorized committee of any candidate for federal election, or a separate segregated fund.\n\n(b) Payments for administrative expenses, voter drives and certain public communications—(1) Costs to be allocated. Separate segregated funds and nonconnected committees that make disbursements in connection with Federal and non-Federal elections shall allocate expenses for the following categories of activity in accordance with paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section:\n\n(i) Administrative expenses including rent, utilities, office supplies, and salaries not attributable to a clearly identified candidate, except that for a separate segregated fund such expenses may be paid instead by its connected organization;\n\n(ii) The direct costs of a fundraising program or event including disbursements for solicitation of funds and for planning and administration of actual fundraising events, where Federal and non-Federal funds are collected through such program or event, except that for a separate segregated fund such expenses may be paid instead by its connected organization;\n\n(iii) Generic voter drives including voter identification, voter registration, and get-out-the-vote drives, or any other activities that urge the general public to register, vote or support candidates of a particular party or associated with a particular issue, without mentioning a specific candidate; and\n\n(iv) Public communications that refer to a political party, but do not refer to any clearly identified Federal or non-Federal candidate;\n\n(2) Costs not subject to allocation. Separate segregated funds and nonconnected committees that make disbursements for the following categories of activity shall pay for those activities in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section:\n\n(i) Voter drives, including voter identification, voter registration, and get-out-the-vote drives, in which the printed materials or scripted messages refer to, or the written instructions direct the separate segregated fund's or nonconnected committee's employee or volunteer to refer to:\n\n(A) One or more clearly identified Federal candidates, but do not refer to any clearly identified non-Federal candidates; or\n\n(B) One or more clearly identified Federal candidates and also refer to candidates of a particular party or associated with a particular issue, but do not refer to any clearly identified non-Federal candidates;\n\n(ii) Voter drives, including voter identification, voter registration, and get-out-the-vote drives, in which the printed materials or scripted messages refer to, or the written instructions direct the separate segregated fund's or nonconnected committee's employee or volunteer to refer to:\n\n(A) One or more clearly identified non-Federal candidates, but do not refer to any clearly identified Federal candidates; or\n\n(B) One or more clearly identified non-Federal candidates and also refer to candidates of a particular party or associated with a particular issue, but do not refer to any clearly identified Federal candidates;\n\n(iii) Public communications that refer to one or more clearly identified Federal candidates, regardless of whether there is reference to a political party, but do not refer to any clearly identified non-Federal candidates; and\n\n(iv) Public communications that refer to a political party, and refer to one or more clearly identified non-Federal candidates, but do not refer to any clearly identified Federal candidates.\n\n(c) [Reserved]\n\n(d) Method for allocating direct costs of fundraising. (1) If federal and non-federal funds are collected by one committee through a joint activity, that committee shall allocate its direct costs of fundraising, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, according to the funds received method. Under this method, the committee shall allocate its fundraising costs based on the ratio of funds received into its federal account to its total receipts from each fundraising program or event. This ratio shall be estimated prior to each such program or event based upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its federal and non-federal revenue from that program or event, and shall be noted in the committee's report for the period in which the first disbursement for such program or event occurred, submitted pursuant to 11 CFR 104.5. Any disbursements for fundraising costs made prior to the actual program or event shall be allocated according to this estimated ratio.\n\n(2) No later than the date 60 days after each fundraising program or event from which both federal and non-federal funds are collected, the committee shall adjust the allocation ratio for that program or event to reflect the actual ratio of funds received.

If the federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall make any transfers of funds from its non-federal to its federal account to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio within the 60-day time period established by this paragraph. The committee shall make note of any such adjustments and transfers in its report for any period in which a transfer was made, and shall also report the date of the fundraising program or event which serves as the basis for the transfer. In the case of a telemarketing or direct mail campaign, the “date” for purposes of this paragraph is the last day of the telemarketing campaign, or the day on which the final direct mail solicitations are mailed.\n\n(e) Payment of allocable expenses by committees with separate federal and non-federal accounts—(1) Payment options.

Therefore, these committees shall not allocate expenditures and disbursements between Federal and non-Federal accounts. All disbursements by a national party committee must be made from a Federal account.\n\n(b) State, district, and local party committees that make expenditures and disbursements in connection with both Federal and non-Federal elections for activities that are not Federal election activities pursuant to 11 CFR 100.24 may use only funds subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the Act, or they may allocate such expenditures and disbursements between their Federal and their non-Federal accounts.

If Federal and non-Federal funds are collected by a State, district, or local party committee through a joint fundraising activity, that committee must allocate its direct fundraising costs using the funds received method and according to the following procedures:\n\n(i) The committee must allocate its fundraising costs based on the ratio of funds received into its Federal account to its total receipts from each fundraising program or event. This ratio shall be estimated prior to each such program or event based upon the committee's reasonable prediction of its Federal and non-Federal revenue from that program or event, and must be noted in the committee's report for the period in which the first disbursement for such program or event occurred, submitted pursuant to 11 CFR 104.5. Any disbursements for fundraising costs made prior to the actual program or event must be allocated according to this estimated ratio.\n\n(ii) No later than the date 60 days after each fundraising program or event from which both Federal and non-Federal funds are collected, the committee shall adjust the allocation ratio for that program or event to reflect the actual ratio of funds received. If the non-Federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall transfer funds from its Federal to its non-Federal account, as necessary, to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio. If the Federal account has paid more than its allocable share, the committee shall make any transfers of funds from its non-Federal to its Federal account to reflect the adjusted allocation ratio within the 60-day time period established by this paragraph. The committee shall make note of any such adjustments and transfers in its report for any period in which a transfer was made, and shall also report the date of the fundraising program or event that serves as the basis for the transfer. In the case of a telemarketing or direct mail campaign, the date for purposes of this paragraph is the last day of the telemarketing campaign, or the day on which the final direct mail solicitations are mailed.\n\n(e) Costs not allocable by State, district, and local party committees between Federal and non-Federal accounts. The following costs incurred by State, district, and local party committees shall be paid only with Federal funds:\n\n(1) Disbursements for State, district, and local party committees for activities that refer only to one or more candidates for Federal office must not be allocated. All such disbursements must be made from a Federal account.\n\n(2) Salaries and wages.

The public communication refers to a political party, does not refer to a clearly identified Federal candidate, and is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in a jurisdiction in which one or more candidates of that political party will appear on the ballot.\n\n(A) When the public communication is coordinated with a candidate and it is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in that candidate's jurisdiction, the time period in paragraph (c)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section that would apply to a communication containing a reference to that candidate applies;\n\n(B) When the public communication is coordinated with a political party committee and it is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated during the two-year election cycle ending on the date of a regularly scheduled non-Presidential general election, the time period in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section applies;\n\n(C) When the public communication is coordinated with a political party committee and it is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated during the two-year election cycle ending on the date of a Presidential general election, the time period in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section applies.\n\n(iv) References to both political parties and clearly identified Federal candidates. The public communication refers to a political party and a clearly identified Federal candidate, and is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in a jurisdiction in which one or more candidates of that political party will appear on the ballot.\n\n(A) When the public communication is coordinated with a candidate and it is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in that candidate's jurisdiction, the time period in paragraph (c)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section that would apply to a communication containing a reference to that candidate applies;\n\n(B) When the public communication is coordinated with a political party committee and it is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in the clearly identified candidate's jurisdiction, the time period in paragraph (c)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section that would apply to a communication containing only a reference to that candidate applies;\n\n(C) When the public communication is coordinated with a political party committee and it is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated outside the clearly identified candidate's jurisdiction, the time period in paragraph (c)(4)(iii)(B) or (C) of this section that would apply to a communication containing only a reference to a political party applies.\n\n(5) A public communication, as defined in 11 CFR 100.26, that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy. For purposes of this section, a communication is the functional equivalent of express advocacy if it is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a clearly identified Federal candidate.\n\n(d) Conduct standards. Any one of the following types of conduct satisfies the conduct standard of this section whether or not there is agreement or formal collaboration, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section:\n\n(1) Request or suggestion. (i) The communication is created, produced, or distributed at the request or suggestion of a candidate, authorized committee, or political party committee; or\n\n(ii) The communication is created, produced, or distributed at the suggestion of a person paying for the communication and the candidate, authorized committee, or political party committee assents to the suggestion.\n\n(2) Material involvement. This paragraph, (d)(2), is not satisfied if the information material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication was obtained from a publicly available source. A candidate, authorized committee, or political party committee is materially involved in decisions regarding:\n\n(i) The content of the communication;\n\n(ii) The intended audience for the communication;\n\n(iii) The means or mode of the communication;\n\n(iv) The specific media outlet used for the communication;\n\n(v) The timing or frequency of the communication; or\n\n(vi) The size or prominence of a printed communication, or duration of a communication by means of broadcast, cable, or satellite.\n\n(3) Substantial discussion. This paragraph, (d)(3), is not satisfied if the information material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication was obtained from a publicly available source. The communication is created, produced, or distributed after one or more substantial discussions about the communication between the person paying for the communication, or the employees or agents of the person paying for the communication, and the candidate who is clearly identified in the communication, or the candidate's authorized committee, the candidate's opponent, the opponent's authorized committee, or a political party committee. A discussion is substantial within the meaning of this paragraph if information about the candidate's or political party committee's campaign plans, projects, activities, or needs is conveyed to a person paying for the communication, and that information is material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication.\n\n(4) Common vendor. All of the following statements in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (d)(4)(iii) of this section are true:\n\n(i) The person paying for the communication, or an agent of such person, contracts with or employs a commercial vendor, as defined in 11 CFR 116.1(c), to create, produce, or distribute the communication;\n\n(ii) That commercial vendor, including any owner, officer, or employee of the commercial vendor, has provided any of the following services to the candidate who is clearly identified in the communication, or the candidate's authorized committee, the candidate's opponent, the opponent's authorized committee, or a political party committee, during the previous 120 days:\n\n(A) Development of media strategy, including the selection or purchasing of advertising slots;\n\n(B) Selection of audiences;\n\n(C) Polling;\n\n(D) Fundraising;\n\n(E) Developing the content of a public communication;\n\n(F) Producing a public communication;\n\n(G) Identifying voters or developing voter lists, mailing lists, or donor lists;\n\n(H) Selecting personnel, contractors, or subcontractors; or\n\n(I) Consulting or otherwise providing political or media advice; and\n\n(iii) This paragraph, (d)(4)(iii), is not satisfied if the information material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication used or conveyed by the commercial vendor was obtained from a publicly available source. That commercial vendor uses or conveys to the person paying for the communication:\n\n(A) Information about the campaign plans, projects, activities, or needs of the clearly identified candidate, the candidate's opponent, or a political party committee, and that information is material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication; or\n\n(B) Information used previously by the commercial vendor in providing services to the candidate who is clearly identified in the communication, or the candidate's authorized committee, the candidate's opponent, the opponent's authorized committee, or a political party committee, and that information is material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication.\n\n(5) Former employee or independent contractor. Both of the following statements in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (d)(5)(ii) of this section are true:\n\n(i) The communication is paid for by a person, or by the employer of a person, who was an employee or independent contractor of the candidate who is clearly identified in the communication, or the candidate's authorized committee, the candidate's opponent, the opponent's authorized committee, or a political party committee, during the previous 120 days; and\n\n(ii) This paragraph, (d)(5)(ii), is not satisfied if the information material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication used or conveyed by the former employee or independent contractor was obtained from a publicly available source. That former employee or independent contractor uses or conveys to the person paying for the communication:\n\n(A) Information about the campaign plans, projects, activities, or needs of the clearly identified candidate, the candidate's opponent, or a political party committee, and that information is material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication; or\n\n(B) Information used by the former employee or independent contractor in providing services to the candidate who is clearly identified in the communication, or the candidate's authorized committee, the candidate's opponent, the opponent's authorized committee, or a political party committee, and that information is material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication.\n\n(6) Dissemination, distribution, or republication of campaign material. A communication that satisfies the content standard of paragraph (c)(2) of this section or 11 CFR 109.37(a)(2)(i) shall only satisfy the conduct standards of paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section on the basis of conduct by the candidate, the candidate's authorized committee, or the agents of any of the foregoing, that occurs after the original preparation of the campaign materials that are disseminated, distributed, or republished. The conduct standards of paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section may also apply to such communications as provided in those paragraphs.\n\n(e) Agreement or formal collaboration. Agreement or formal collaboration between the person paying for the communication and the candidate clearly identified in the communication, or the candidate's authorized committee, the candidate's opponent, the opponent's authorized committee, or a political party committee, is not required for a communication to be a coordinated communication. Agreement means a mutual understanding or meeting of the minds on all or any part of the material aspects of the communication or its dissemination. Formal collaboration means planned, or systematically organized, work on the communication.\n\n(f) Safe harbor for responses to inquiries about legislative or policy issues. A candidate's or a political party committee's response to an inquiry about that candidate's or political party committee's positions on legislative or policy issues, but not including a discussion of campaign plans, projects, activities, or needs, does not satisfy any of the conduct standards in paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(g) Safe harbor for endorsements and solicitations by Federal candidates. (1) A public communication in which a candidate for Federal office endorses another candidate for Federal or non-Federal office is not a coordinated communication with respect to the endorsing Federal candidate unless the public communication promotes, supports, attacks, or opposes the endorsing candidate or another candidate who seeks election to the same office as the endorsing candidate.\n\n(2) A public communication in which a candidate for Federal office solicits funds for another candidate for Federal or non-Federal office, a political committee, or organizations as permitted by 11 CFR 300.65, is not a coordinated communication with respect to the soliciting Federal candidate unless the public communication promotes, supports, attacks, or opposes the soliciting candidate or another candidate who seeks election to the same office as the soliciting candidate.\n\n(h) Safe harbor for establishment and use of a firewall. The conduct standards in paragraph (d) of this section are not met if the commercial vendor, former employee, or political committee has established and implemented a firewall that meets the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section. This safe harbor provision does not apply if specific information indicates that, despite the firewall, information about the candidate's or political party committee's campaign plans, projects, activities, or needs that is material to the creation, production, or distribution of the communication was used or conveyed to the person paying for the communication.\n\n(1) The firewall must be designed and implemented to prohibit the flow of information between employees or consultants providing services for the person paying for the communication and those employees or consultants currently or previously providing services to the candidate who is clearly identified in the communication, or the candidate's authorized committee, the candidate's opponent, the opponent's authorized committee, or a political party committee; and\n\n(2) The firewall must be described in a written policy that is distributed to all relevant employees, consultants, and clients affected by the policy.\n\n(i) Safe harbor for commercial transactions. A public communication in which a Federal candidate is clearly identified only in his or her capacity as the owner or operator of a business that existed prior to the candidacy is not a coordinated communication with respect to the clearly identified candidate if:\n\n(1) The medium, timing, content, and geographic distribution of the public communication are consistent with public communications made prior to the candidacy; and\n\n(2) The public communication does not promote, support, attack, or oppose that candidate or another candidate who seeks the same office as that candidate.\n\n[68 FR 451, Jan. 3, 2003, as amended at 71 FR 33208, June 8, 2006; 75 FR 55961, Sept. 15, 2010]",

A political party communication is coordinated with a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee, or agent of any of the foregoing, when the communication satisfies the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section.\n\n(1) The communication is paid for by a political party committee or its agent.\n\n(2) The communication satisfies at least one of the content standards described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iii) of this section.\n\n(i) A public communication that disseminates, distributes, or republishes, in whole or in part, campaign materials prepared by a candidate, the candidate's authorized committee, or an agent of any of the foregoing, unless the dissemination, distribution, or republication is excepted under 11 CFR 109.23(b). For a communication that satisfies this content standard, see 11 CFR 109.21(d)(6).\n\n(ii) A public communication that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for Federal office.\n\n(iii) A public communication, as defined in 11 CFR 100.26, that satisfies paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section:\n\n(A) References to House and Senate candidates. The public communication refers to a clearly identified House or Senate candidate and is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in the clearly identified candidate's jurisdiction 90 days or fewer before the clearly identified candidate's general, special, or runoff election, or primary or preference election, or nominating convention or caucus.\n\n(B) References to Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates. The public communication refers to a clearly identified Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate and is publicly distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in a jurisdiction during the period of time beginning 120 days before the clearly identified candidate's primary or preference election in that jurisdiction, or nominating convention or caucus in that jurisdiction, up to and including the day of the general election.\n\n(3) The communication satisfies at least one of the conduct standards in 11 CFR 109.21(d)(1) through (d)(6), subject to the provisions of 11 CFR 109.21(e), (g), and (h). A candidate's response to an inquiry about that candidate's positions on legislative or policy issues, but not including a discussion of campaign plans, projects, activities, or needs, does not satisfy any of the conduct standards in 11 CFR 109.21(d)(1) through (d)(6). Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the candidate with whom a party coordinated communication is coordinated does not receive or accept an in-kind contribution, and is not required to report an expenditure that results from conduct described in 11 CFR 109.21(d)(4) or (d)(5), unless the candidate, authorized committee, or an agent of any of the foregoing, engages in conduct described in 11 CFR 109.21(d)(1) through (d)(3).\n\n(b) Treatment of a party coordinated communication. A payment by a political party committee for a communication that is coordinated with a candidate, and that is not otherwise exempted under 11 CFR part 100, subpart C or E, must be treated by the political party committee making the payment as either:\n\n(1) An in-kind contribution for the purpose of influencing a Federal election under 11 CFR 100.52(d) to the candidate with whom it was coordinated, which must be reported under 11 CFR part 104; or\n\n(2) A coordinated party expenditure pursuant to coordinated party expenditure authority under 11 CFR 109.32 in connection with the general election campaign of the candidate with whom it was coordinated, which must be reported under 11 CFR part 104.\n\n[68 FR 451, Jan. 3, 2003, as amended at 71 FR 33210, June 8, 2006]",

(1) No person shall make contributions to any candidate, his or her authorized political committees or agents with respect to any election for Federal office that, in the aggregate, exceed $2,000.\n\n(i) The contribution limitation in the introductory text of paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be increased by the percent difference in the price index in accordance with 11 CFR 110.17.\n\n(ii) The increased contribution limitation shall be in effect for the 2-year period beginning on the first day following the date of the last general election in the year preceding the year in which the contribution limitation is increased and ending on the date of the next general election. For example, an increase in the contribution limitation made in January 2005 is effective from November 3, 2004 to November 7, 2006.\n\n(iii) In every odd numbered year, the Commission will publish in the Federal Register the amount of the contribution limitation in effect and place such information on the Commission's Web site.\n\n(2) For purposes of this section, with respect to any election means—\n\n(i) In the case of a contribution designated in writing by the contributor for a particular election, the election so designated. Contributors to candidates are encouraged to designate their contributions in writing for particular elections. See 11 CFR 110.1(b)(4).\n\n(ii) In the case of a contribution not designated in writing by the contributor for a particular election, the next election for that Federal office after the contribution is made.\n\n(3)(i) A contribution designated in writing for a particular election, but made after that election, shall be made only to the extent that the contribution does not exceed net debts outstanding from such election. To the extent that such contribution exceeds net debts outstanding, the candidate or the candidate's authorized political committee shall return or deposit the contribution within ten days from the date of the treasurer's receipt of the contribution as provided by 11 CFR 103.3(a), and if deposited, then within sixty days from the date of the treasurer's receipt the treasurer shall take the following action, as appropriate:\n\n(A) Refund the contribution using a committee check or similar draft, including electronic transfer; or\n\n(B) Obtain a written redesignation by the contributor for another election in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5); or\n\n(C) Obtain a written reattribution to another contributor in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k)(3).\n\nIf the candidate is not a candidate in the general election, all contributions made for the general election shall be either returned or refunded to the contributors or redesignated in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(b)(5), or reattributed in accordance with 11 CFR 110.1(k)(3), as appropriate.\n\n(ii) In order to determine whether there are net debts outstanding from a particular election, the treasurer of the candidate's authorized political committee shall calculate net debts outstanding as of the date of the election.

For the purposes of this section, local unit may include, in appropriate cases, a franchisee, licensee, or State or regional association.\n\n(2) Affiliated committees sharing a single contribution limitation under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section include all of the committees established, financed, maintained or controlled by—\n\n(i) A single corporation and/or its subsidiaries;\n\n(ii) A single national or international union and/or its local unions or other subordinate organizations;\n\n(iii) An organization of national or international unions and/or all its State and local central bodies;\n\n(iv) A membership organization, (other than political party committees, see paragraph (b) of this section) including trade or professional associations, see 11 CFR 114.8(a), and/or related State and local entities of that organization or group; or\n\n(v) The same person or group of persons.\n\n(3)(i) The Commission may examine the relationship between organizations that sponsor committees, between the committees themselves, or between one sponsoring organization and a committee established by another organization to determine whether committees are affiliated.\n\n(ii) In determining whether committees not described in paragraphs (a)(2) (i)-(iv) of this section are affiliated, the Commission will consider the circumstantial factors described in paragraphs (a)(3)(ii) (A) through (J) of this section. The Commission will examine these factors in the context of the overall relationship between committees or sponsoring organizations to determine whether the presence of any factor or factors is evidence of one committee or organization having been established, financed, maintained or controlled by another committee or sponsoring organization. Such factors include, but are not limited to:\n\n(A) Whether a sponsoring organization owns a controlling interest in the voting stock or securities of the sponsoring organization of another committee;\n\n(B) Whether a sponsoring organization or committee has the authority or ability to direct or participate in the governance of another sponsoring organization or committee through provisions of constitutions, bylaws, contracts, or other rules, or through formal or informal practices or procedures;\n\n(C) Whether a sponsoring organization or committee has the authority or ability to hire, appoint, demote or otherwise control the officers, or other decisionmaking employees or members of another sponsoring organization or committee;\n\n(D) Whether a sponsoring organization or committee has a common or overlapping membership with another sponsoring organization or committee which indicates a formal or ongoing relationship between the sponsoring organizations or committees;\n\n(E) Whether a sponsoring organization or committee has common or overlapping officers or employees with another sponsoring organization or committee which indicates a formal or ongoing relationship between the sponsoring organizations or committees;\n\n(F) Whether a sponsoring organization or committee has any members, officers or employees who were members, officers or employees of another sponsoring organization or committee which indicates a formal or ongoing relationship between the sponsoring organizations or committees, or which indicates the creation of a successor entity;\n\n(G) Whether a sponsoring organization or committee provides funds or goods in a significant amount or on an ongoing basis to another sponsoring organization or committee, such as through direct or indirect payments for administrative, fundraising, or other costs, but not including the transfer to a committee of its allocated share of proceeds jointly raised pursuant to 11 CFR 102.17;\n\n(H) Whether a sponsoring organization or committee causes or arranges for funds in a significant amount or on an ongoing basis to be provided to another sponsoring organization or committee, but not including the transfer to a committee of its allocated share of proceeds jointly raised pursuant to 11 CFR 102.17;\n\n(I) Whether a sponsoring organization or a committee or its agent had an active or significant role in the formation of another sponsoring organization or committee; and\n\n(J) Whether the sponsoring organizations or committees have similar patterns of contributions or contributors which indicates a formal or ongoing relationshp between the sponsoring organizations or committees.\n\n(b) Contribution limitations for political party committees. (1) For the purposes of the contribution limitations of 11 CFR 110.1 and 110.2, all contributions made or received by the following political committees shall be considered to be made or received by separate political committees—\n\n(i) The national committee of a political party and any political committees established, financed, maintained, or controlled by the same national committee; and\n\n(ii) The State committee of the same political party.\n\n(2) Application of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section means that—\n\n(i) The House campaign committee and the national committee of a political party shall have separate limitations on contributions under 11 CFR 110.1 and 110.2.\n\n(ii) The Senate campaign committee and the national committee of a political party shall have separate limitations on contributions, except that contributions to a senatorial candidate made by the Senate campaign committee and the national committee of a political party are subject to a single contribution limitation under 11 CFR 110.2(e).\n\n(3) All contributions made by the political committees established, financed, maintained, or controlled by a State party committee and by subordinate State party committees shall be presumed to be made by one political committee. This presumption shall not apply if—\n\n(i) The political committee of the party unit in question has not received funds from any other political committee established, financed, maintained, or controlled by any party unit; and\n\n(ii) The political committee of the party unit in question does not make its contributions in cooperation, consultation or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of any other party unit or political committee established, financed, maintained, or controlled by another party unit.\n\n(c) Permissible Transfers. The contribution limitations of 11 CFR 110.1 and 110.2 shall not limit the transfers set forth below in 11 CFR 110.3(c) (1) through (6)—\n\n(1) Transfers of funds between affiliated committees or between party committees of the same political party whether or not they are affiliated or by collecting agents to a separate segregated fund made pursuant to 11 CFR 102.6;\n\n(2) Transfers of joint fundraising proceeds between organizations or committees participating in the joint fundraising activity provided that no participating committee or organization governed by 11 CFR 102.17 received more than its allocated share of the funds raised;\n\n(3) Transfers of funds between the primary campaign and general election campaign of a candidate of funds unused for the primary;\n\n(4) Transfers of funds between a candidate's previous Federal campaign committee and his or her current Federal campaign committee, or between previous Federal campaign committees, provided that the candidate is not a candidate for more than one Federal office at the same time, and provided that the funds transferred are not composed of contributions that would be in violation of the Act. The cash on hand from which the transfer is made shall be considered to consist of the funds most recently received by the transferor committee. The transferor committee must be able to demonstrate that such cash on hand contains sufficient funds at the time of the transfer that comply with the limitations and prohibitions of the Act to cover the amount transferred.\n\n(i) Previous Federal campaign committee means a principal campaign committee, or other authorized committee, that was organized to further the candidate's campaign in a Federal election that has already been held.\n\n(ii) Current Federal campaign committee means a principal campaign committee, or other authorized committee, organized to further the candidate's campaign in a future Federal election.\n\n(iii) For purposes of the contribution limits, a contribution made after an election has been held, or after an individual ceases to be a candidate in an election, shall be aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor for the next election unless the contribution is designated for the previous election, or is designated for another election, and the candidate has net debts outstanding for the election so designated pursuant to 11 CFR 110.1(b)(3).\n\n(iv) For purposes of this section, an individual ceases to be a candidate in an election as of the earlier of the following dates—\n\n(A) The date on which the candidate publicly announces that he or she will no longer be a candidate in that election for that office and ceases to conduct campaign activities with respect to that election; or\n\n(B) The date on which the candidate is or becomes ineligible for nomination or election to that office by operation of law;\n\n(5) Transfers of funds between the principal campaign committees of an individual seeking nomination or election to more than one Federal office, as long as the conditions in 11 CFR 110.3(c)(5) (i), (ii) and (iii) are met. An individual will be considered to be seeking nomination or election to more than one Federal office if the individual is concurrently a candidate for more than one Federal office during the same or overlapping election cycles.\n\n(i) The transfer shall not be made when the individual is actively seeking nomination or election to more than one Federal office. An individual will not be considered to be actively seeking nomination or election to a Federal office if:\n\n(A) The individual publicly announces that he or she will no longer seek nomination or election to that office and ceases to conduct campaign activities with respect to that election, except in connection with the retirement of debts outstanding at the time of the announcement;\n\n(B) The individual is or becomes ineligible for nomination or election to that office by operation of law;\n\n(C) The individual has filed a proper termination report with the Commission under 11 CFR 102.3; or\n\n(D) The individual has notified the Commission in writing that the individual and his or her authorized committees will conduct no further campaign activities with respect to that election, except in connection with the retirement of debts outstanding at the time of the notification;\n\n(ii) The limitations on contributions by persons shall not be exceeded by the transfer. The cash on hand from which the transfer is made shall be considered to consist of the funds most recently received by the transferor committee. The transferor committee must be able to demonstrate that such cash on hand contains sufficient funds at the time of the transfer that comply with the limitations and prohibitions of the Act to cover the amount transferred. A contribution shall be excluded from the amount transferred to the extent that such contribution, when aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor to the transferee principal campaign committee, exceeds the contribution limits set forth at 11 CFR 110.1 or 110.2, as appropriate; and\n\n(iii) The candidate has not elected to receive funds under 26 U.S.C. 9006 or 9037 for either election; or\n\n(6) [Reserved]\n\n(7) The authorized committees of a candidate for more than one Federal office, or for a Federal office and a nonfederal office, shall follow the requirements for separate campaign organizations set forth at 11 CFR 110.8(d).\n\n(d) Transfers from nonfederal to federal campaigns. Transfers of funds or assets from a candidate's campaign committee or account for a nonfederal election to his or her principal campaign committee or other authorized committee for a federal election are prohibited. However, at the option of the nonfederal committee, the nonfederal committee may refund contributions, and may coordinate arrangements with the candidate's principal campaign committee or other authorized committee for a solicitation by such committee(s) to the same contributors. The full cost of this solicitation shall be paid by the Federal committee.\n\n[54 FR 34110, Aug. 17, 1989, and 54 FR 48580, Nov. 24, 1989; 58 FR 3476, Jan. 8, 1993]",

    "content": "When used in this part—\n\n(a) Funds donated. Funds donated means all funds, including, but not limited to, gifts, loans, advances, credits or deposits of money which are donated for the purpose of supporting the activities of a Federal or State officeholder; but does not mean funds appropriated by Congress, a State legislature, or another similar public appropriating body, or personal funds of the officeholder donated to an account containing only those personal funds.\n\n(b) Office account. Office account means an account established for the purposes of supporting the activities of a Federal or State officeholder which contains campaign funds and funds donated, but does not include an account used exclusively for funds appropriated by Congress, a State legislature, or another similar public appropriating body, or an account of the officeholder which contains only the personal funds of the officeholder.\n\n(c) Federal officeholder. Federal officeholder means an individual elected to or serving in the office of President or Vice President of the United States; or a Senator or a Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress of the United States.\n\n(d) State officeholder. State officeholder means an individual elected to or serving in any elected public office within a State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or any subdivision thereof.\n\n(e) [Reserved]\n\n(f) Qualified Member. Qualified Member means an individual who was serving as a Senator or Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, Congress, on January 8, 1980.\n\n(g) Personal use. Personal use means any use of funds in a campaign account of a present or former candidate to fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense of any person that would exist irrespective of the candidate's campaign or duties as a Federal officeholder.\n\n(1)(i) Personal use includes but is not limited to the use of funds in a campaign account for any item listed in paragraphs (g)(1)(i)(A) through (J) of this section:\n\n(A) Household food items or supplies.\n\n(B) Funeral, cremation or burial expenses except those incurred for a candidate (as defined in 11 CFR 100.3) or an employee or volunteer of an authorized committee whose death arises out of, or in the course of, campaign activity.\n\n(C) Clothing, other than items of de minimis value that are used in the campaign, such as campaign “T-shirts” or caps with campaign slogans.\n\n(D) Tuition payments, other than those associated with training campaign staff.\n\n(E) Mortgage, rent or utility payments—\n\n(1) For any part of any personal residence of the candidate or a member of the candidate's family; or\n\n(2) For real or personal property that is owned by the candidate or a member of the candidate's family and used for campaign purposes, to the extent the payments exceed the fair market value of the property usage.\n\n(F) Admission to a sporting event, concert, theater or other form of entertainment, unless part of a specific campaign or officeholder activity.\n\n(G) Dues, fees or gratuities at a country club, health club, recreational facility or other nonpolitical organization, unless they are part of the costs of a specific fundraising event that takes place on the organization's premises.\n\n(H) Salary payments to a member of the candidate's family, unless the family member is providing bona fide services to the campaign. If a family member provides bona fide services to the campaign, any salary payment in excess of the fair market value of the services provided is personal use.\n\n(I) [Reserved]\n\n(J) A vacation.\n\n(ii) The Commission will determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether other uses of funds in a campaign account fulfill a commitment, obligation or expense that would exist irrespective of the candidate's campaign or duties as a Federal officeholder, and therefore are personal use. Examples of such other uses include:\n\n(A) Legal expenses;\n\n(B) Meal expenses;\n\n(C) Travel expenses, including subsistence expenses incurred during travel. If a committee uses campaign funds to pay expenses associated with travel that involves both personal activities and campaign or officeholder-related activities, the incremental expenses that result from the personal activities are personal use, unless the person(s) benefiting from this use reimburse(s) the campaign account within thirty days for the amount of the incremental expenses, and\n\n(D) Vehicle expenses, unless they are a de minimis amount. If a committee uses campaign funds to pay expenses associated with a vehicle that is used for both personal activities beyond a de minimis amount and campaign or officeholder-related activities, the portion of the vehicle expenses associated with the personal activities is personal use, unless the person(s) using the vehicle for personal activities reimburse(s) the campaign account within thirty days for the expenses associated with the personal activities.\n\n(2) Charitable donations. Donations of campaign funds or assets to an organization described in section 170(c) of Title 26 of the United States Code are not personal use, unless the candidate receives compensation from the organization before the organization has expended the entire amount donated for purposes unrelated to his or her personal benefit.\n\n(3) Transfers of campaign assets. The transfer of a campaign committee asset is not personal use so long as the transfer is for fair market value. Any depreciation that takes place before the transfer must be allocated between the committee and the purchaser based on the useful life of the asset.\n\n(4) Gifts. Gifts of nominal value and donations of a nominal amount made on a special occasion such as a holiday, graduation, marriage, retirement, or death are not personal use, unless made to a member of the candidate's family.\n\n(5) Political or officially connected expenses. The use of campaign funds for an expense that would be a political expense under the rules of the United States House of Representatives or an officially connected expense under the rules of the United States Senate is not personal use to the extent that the expense is an expenditure under subpart D of part 100 or an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a holder of Federal office. Any use of funds that would be personal use under paragraph (g)(1) of this section will not be considered an expenditure under subpart D of part 100 or an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a holder of Federal office.\n\n(6) Candidate compensation. (i) A Federal officeholder, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, must not receive compensation as a candidate from campaign funds.\n\n(ii) The use of campaign funds by a candidate's principal campaign committee to pay compensation to the candidate is not personal use, provided that the compensation does not exceed the lesser of: 50% of the minimum annual salary paid to a Member of the United States House of Representatives under 2 U.S.C. 4501, and the average annual income that the candidate earned during the most recent five calendar years in which the candidate earned income prior to becoming a candidate. The committee must calculate compensation, minimum annual salary, and average annual income at the daily rate, rounded to the nearest dollar.\n\n(iii) For the purposes of this paragraph, compensation means direct payments to the candidate unless the payments are otherwise permitted by law, such as candidate expense reimbursements and candidate loan repayments under 11 CFR part 116.\n\n(iv) The candidate's principal campaign committee must reduce the maximum amount of candidate compensation permissible under this paragraph (g)(6) by the amount of any earned income the candidate receives from any other source after filing a Statement of Candidacy under 11 CFR 101.1(a).\n\n(v)(A) Compensation shall not accrue or be paid to a candidate before the date the candidate files a Statement of Candidacy with the Commission. See 11 CFR 101.1(a).\n\n(B) A candidate's principal campaign committee may pay the candidate compensation from campaign funds up to 20 days after the candidate wins the general election, general election runoff, special election, or special election runoff, or otherwise ceases to be a candidate, such as by losing an election or withdrawing from the race.\n\n(vi) Any principal campaign committee seeking to settle debts for less than the full value may not pay compensation to the candidate or settle or satisfy a debt to a candidate for compensation.\n\n(vii) The candidate must provide evidence of earned income from the relevant years upon the request of the Commission. Any such evidence of earned income must be maintained and preserved for three years after the report disclosing the disbursement is filed, pursuant to 11 CFR 102.9 and 104.14(b).\n\n(7) Third party payments. Notwithstanding that the use of funds for a particular expense would be a personal use under this section, payment of that expense by any person other than the candidate or the campaign committee shall be a contribution under subpart B of part 100 to the candidate unless the payment would have been made irrespective of the candidacy. Examples of payments considered to be irrespective of the candidacy include, but are not limited to, situations where—\n\n(i) The payment is a donation to a legal expense trust fund established in accordance with the rules of the United States Senate or the United States House of Representatives;\n\n(ii) The payment is made from funds that are the candidate's personal funds as defined in 11 CFR 100.33, including an account jointly held by the candidate and a member of the candidate's family;\n\n(iii) Payments for that expense were made by the person making the payment before the candidate became a candidate. Payments that are compensation shall be considered contributions unless—\n\n(A) The compensation results from bona fide employment that is genuinely independent of the candidacy;\n\n(B) The compensation is exclusively in consideration of services provided by the employee as part of this employment; and\n\n(C) The compensation does not exceed the amount of compensation which would be paid to any other similarly qualified person for the same work over the same period of time.\n\n(8) Members of the candidate's family. For the purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, the candidate's family includes:\n\n(i) The spouse of the candidate;\n\n(ii) Any child, step-child, parent, grandparent, sibling, half-sibling or step-sibling of the candidate or the candidate's spouse;\n\n(iii) The spouse of any child, step-child, parent, grandparent, sibling, half-sibling or step-sibling of the candidate; and\n\n(iv) A person who shares a residence with the candidate.\n\n(9) Recordkeeping. For those uses of campaign funds described in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (g)(1)(ii) of this section that involve both personal use and either campaign or office-holder use, a contemporaneous log or other record must be kept to document the dates and expenses related to the personal use of the campaign funds. The log must be updated whenever campaign funds are used for personal expenses, as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, rather than for campaign or office-holder expenses. The log or other record must also be maintained and preserved for 3 years after the report disclosing the disbursement is filed, pursuant to 11 CFR 102.9 and 104.14(b).\n\n(10) Candidate and federal officeholder security. The use of campaign funds to pay for the reasonable costs of security measures for a federal candidate, federal officeholder, member of their family, and employees—as defined in 26 CFR 31.3401(c)-1)—of the candidate's campaign or the federal officeholder's office, is not personal use, so long as the security measures address ongoing dangers or threats that would not exist irrespective of the individual's status or duties as a federal candidate or federal officeholder. Disbursements for security measures must be for the usual and normal charge for such goods or services. Usual and normal charge means, in the case of goods, the price of those goods in the market in which they are ordinarily purchased, and, in the case of services, the hourly or piecework charge for the services at a commercially reasonable rate prevailing at the time the services were rendered. Examples of such security measures include, but are not limited to:\n\n(i) Non-structural security devices, such as security hardware, locks, alarm systems, motion detectors, and security camera systems;\n\n(ii) Structural security devices, such as wiring, lighting, gates, doors, and fencing, so long as such devices are intended solely to provide security and not to improve the property or increase its value;\n\n(iii) Security personnel and services that are bona fide, legitimate, and professional; and\n\n(iv) Cybersecurity software, devices, and services.\n\n[45 FR 15124, Mar. 7, 1980, as amended at 56 FR 34126, July 25, 1991; 60 FR 7874, Feb. 9, 1995; 67 FR 38361, June 4, 2002; 67 FR 76978, Dec. 13, 2002; 73 FR 79602, Dec. 30, 2008; 75 FR 32, Jan. 4, 2010; 79 FR 77849, Dec. 29, 2014; 81 FR 34863, June 1, 2016; 89 FR 13, Jan. 2, 2024; 89 FR 78206, Sept. 25, 2024]",

For example, such rights could include the right to vote directly or indirectly for at least one individual on the membership organization's highest governing board; the right to vote directly for organization officers; the right to vote on policy questions where the highest governing body of the membership organization is obligated to abide by the results; the right to approve the organization's annual budget; or the right to participate directly in similar aspects of the organization's governance.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the Commission may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that persons who do not precisely meet the requirements of the general rule, but have a relatively enduring and independently significant financial or organizational attachment to the organization, may be considered members for purposes of this section. For example, student members who pay a lower amount of dues while in school, long term dues paying members who qualify for lifetime membership status with little or no dues obligation, and retired members of the organization may be considered members for purposes of these rules.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section, members of a local union are considered to be members of any national or international union of which the local union is a part and of any federation with which the local, national, or international union is affiliated.\n\n(5) In the case of a membership organization which has a national federation structure or has several levels, including, for example, national, state, regional and/or local affiliates, a person who qualifies as a member of any entity within the federation or of any affiliate by meeting the requirements of paragraphs (e)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section shall also qualify as a member of all affiliates for purposes of this part. The factors set forth at 11 CFR 100.5 (g)(2), (3) and (4) shall be used to determine whether entities are affiliated for purposes of this paragraph.\n\n(6) The status of a membership organization, and of members, for purposes of this part, shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section and not by provisions of state law governing trade associations, cooperatives, corporations without capital stock, or labor organizations.\n\n(f) Method of facilitating the making of contributions means the manner in which the contributions are received or collected such as, but not limited to, payroll deduction or checkoff systems, other periodic payment plans, or return envelopes enclosed in a solicitation request.\n\n(g) Method of soliciting voluntary contributions means the manner in which the solicitation is undertaken including, but not limited to, mailings, emails, oral requests for contributions, and hand distribution of pamphlets.\n\n(h) Stockholder means a person who has a vested beneficial interest in stock, has the power to direct how that stock shall be voted, if it is voting stock, and has the right to receive dividends.\n\n(i) Voluntary contributions are contributions which have been obtained by the separate segregated fund of a corporation or labor organization in a manner which is in compliance with § 114.5(a) and which is in accordance with other provisions of the Act.\n\n(j) Restricted class. A corporation's restricted class is its stockholders and executive or administrative personnel, and their families, and the executive and administrative personnel of its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and departments and their families. A labor organization's restricted class is its members and executive or administrative personnel, and their families. For communications under 11 CFR 114.3, the restricted class of an incorporated membership organization, incorporated trade association, incorporated cooperative or corporation without capital stock is its members and executive or administrative personnel, and their families. (The solicitable class of a membership organization, cooperative, corporation without capital stock or trade association, as described in 11 CFR 114.7 and 114.8, may include some persons who are not considered part of the organization's restricted class, and may exclude some persons who are in the restricted class.)\n\n[41 FR 35955, Aug. 25, 1976, as amended at 44 FR 63045, Nov. 1, 1979; 45 FR 15125, Mar. 7, 1980; 45 FR 21210, Apr. 1, 1980; 48 FR 50508, Nov. 2, 1983; 57 FR 1640, Jan. 15, 1992; 58 FR 45775, Aug. 30, 1993; 59 FR 33615, June 29, 1994; 60 FR 64273, Dec. 14, 1995; 64 FR 41273, July 30, 1999; 67 FR 49120, July 29, 2002; 67 FR 78681, Dec. 26, 2002; 79 FR 77849, Dec. 29, 2014; 80 FR 62817, Oct. 21, 2014; 89 FR 218, Jan. 2, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) National banks and corporations organized by authority of any law of Congress are prohibited from making a contribution, as defined in 11 CFR 114.1(a), in connection with any election to any political office, including local, State and Federal offices, or in connection with any primary election or political convention or caucus held to select candidates for any political office, including any local, State or Federal office. National banks and corporations organized by authority of any law of Congress are prohibited from making expenditures as defined in 11 CFR 114.1(a) for communications to those outside the restricted class expressly advocating the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate(s) or the candidates of a clearly identified political party, with respect to an election to any political office, including any local, State, or Federal office.\n\n(1) Such national banks and corporations may engage in the activities permitted by 11 CFR part 114, except to the extent that such activity constitutes a contribution, expenditure, or electioneering communication or is foreclosed by provisions of law other than the Act.\n\n(2) The provisions of 11 CFR part 114 apply to the activities of a national bank, or a corporation organized by any law of Congress, in connection with local, State and Federal elections.\n\n(b) Any corporation whatever or any labor organization is prohibited from making a contribution as defined in 11 CFR part 100, subpart B. Any corporation whatever or any labor organization is prohibited from making a contribution as defined in 11 CFR 114.1(a) in connection with any Federal election.\n\nPursuant to SpeechNow.org v. FEC, 599 F.3d 686 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (en banc), and Carey v. FEC, 791 F. Supp. 2d 121 (D.D.C. 2011), corporations and labor organizations may make contributions to nonconnected political committees that make only independent expenditures, or to separate accounts maintained by nonconnected political committees for making only independent expenditures, notwithstanding 11 CFR 114.2(b) and 11 CFR 114.10(a). The Commission has not conducted a rulemaking in response to these cases.\n\n(c) Disbursements by corporations and labor organizations for the election-related activities described in 11 CFR 114.3 and 114.4 will not cause those activities to be contributions when coordinated with any candidate, candidate's agent, candidate's authorized committee(s) or any party committee to the extent permitted in those sections. Coordination beyond that described in 11 CFR 114.3 and 114.4 shall not cause subsequent activities directed at the restricted class to be considered contributions. However, such coordination may be considered evidence that could negate the independence of subsequent communications to those outside the restricted class by the corporation, labor organization or its separate segregated fund, and could result in an in-kind contribution. See 11 CFR 100.16 regarding independent expenditures and coordination with candidates.\n\n(d) A candidate, political committee, or other person is prohibited from knowingly accepting or receiving any contribution prohibited by this section.\n\n(e) No officer or director of any corporation or any national bank, and no officer of any labor organization shall consent to any contribution or expenditure by the corporation, national bank, or labor organization prohibited by this section.\n\n(f) Facilitating the making of contributions. (1) Corporations and labor organizations (including officers, directors or other representatives acting as agents of corporations and labor organizations) are prohibited from facilitating the making of contributions to candidates or political committees, other than to the separate segregated funds of the corporations and labor organizations. Facilitation means using corporate or labor organization resources or facilities to engage in fundraising activities in connection with any federal election, such as activities which go beyond the limited exemptions set forth in 11 CFR part 100, subparts B and C, part 100, subparts D and E, 114.9(a) through (c) and 114.13. A corporation does not facilitate the making of a contribution to a candidate or political committee if it provides goods or services in the ordinary course of its business as a commercial vendor in accordance with 11 CFR part 116 at the usual and normal charge.\n\n(2) Examples of facilitating the making of contributions include but are not limited to—\n\n(i) Fundraising activities by corporations (except commercial vendors) or labor organizations that involve—\n\n(A) Officials or employees of the corporation or labor organization ordering or directing subordinates or support staff (who therefore are not acting as volunteers) to plan, organize or carry out the fundraising project as a part of their work responsibilities using corporate or labor organization resources, unless the corporation or labor organization receives advance payment for the fair market value of such services;\n\n(B) Failure to reimburse a corporation or labor organization within a commercially reasonable time for the use of corporate facilities described in 11 CFR 114.9(d) in connection with such fundraising activities;\n\n(C) Using a corporate or labor organization list of customers, clients, vendors or others who are not in the restricted class to solicit contributions or distribute invitations to the fundraiser, unless the corporation or labor organization receives advance payment for the fair market value of the list;\n\n(D) Using meeting rooms that are not customarily made available to clubs, civic or community organizations or other groups; or\n\n(E) Providing catering or other food services operated or obtained by the corporation or labor organization, unless the corporation or labor organization receives advance payment for the fair market value of the services;\n\n(ii) Providing materials for the purpose of transmitting or delivering contributions, such as stamps, envelopes addressed to a candidate or political committee other than the corporation's or labor organization's separate segregated fund, or other similar items which would assist in transmitting or delivering contributions, but not including providing the address of the candidate or political committee;\n\n(iii) Soliciting contributions earmarked for a candidate that are to be collected and forwarded by the corporation's or labor organizations's separate segregated fund, except to the extent such contributions also are treated as contributions to and by the separate segregated fund; or\n\n(iv) Using coercion, such as the threat of a detrimental job action, the threat of any other financial reprisal, or the threat of force, to urge any individual to make a contribution or engage in fundraising activities on behalf of a candidate or political committee.\n\n(3) Facilitating the making of contributions does not include the following activities if conducted by a separate segregated fund—\n\n(i) Any activity specifically permitted under 11 CFR 110.1, 110.2, or 114.5 through 114.8, including soliciting contributions to a candidate or political committee, and making in kind contributions to a candidate or political committee; and\n\n(ii) Collecting and forwarding contributions earmarked to a candidate in accordance with 11 CFR 110.6.\n\n(4) Facilitating the making of contributions also does not include the following activities if conducted by a corporation or labor organization—\n\n(i) Enrolling members of a corporation's or labor organization's restricted class in a payroll deduction plan or check-off system which deducts contributions from dividend or payroll checks to make contributions to the corporation's or labor organization's separate segregated fund or an employee participation plan pursuant to 11 CFR 114.11;\n\n(ii) Soliciting contributions to be sent directly to candidates if the solicitation is directed to the restricted class, see 11 CFR 114.1(a)(2)(i); and\n\n(iii) Soliciting contributions earmarked for a candidate that are to be collected and forwarded by the corporation's or labor organization's separate segregated fund, to the extent such contributions also are treated as contributions to and by the separate segregated fund.\n\n(5) Facilitating the making of contributions also does not include the provision of incidental services by a corporation to collect and forward contributions from its employee stockholders and executive and administrative personnel to the separate segregated fund of a trade association of which the corporation is a member, including collection through a payroll deduction or check-off system, pursuant to 11 CFR 114.8(e)(4).\n\n[60 FR 64274, Dec. 14, 1995, as amended at 67 FR 65211, Oct. 23, 2002; 67 FR 78681, Dec. 26, 2002; 70 FR 41944, July 21, 2005; 72 FR 72913, Dec. 26, 2007; 79 FR 62817, Oct. 21, 2014; 81 FR 34864, June 1, 2016]",

    "content": "(a) General. (1) Corporations and labor organizations may make communications on any subject, including communications containing express advocacy, to their restricted class or any part of that class. Corporations and labor organizations may also make the communications permitted under 11 CFR 114.4 to their restricted class or any part of that class. The activities permitted under this section may involve election-related coordination with candidates and political committees. See 11 CFR 100.16 and 114.2(c) regarding independent expenditures and coordination with candidates.\n\n(2) Incorporated membership organizations, incorporated trade associations, incorporated cooperatives and corporations without capital stock may make communications to their restricted class, or any part of that class as permitted in paragraphs (a)(1) and (c) of this section.\n\n(b) Reporting communications containing express advocacy to the restricted class. Disbursements for communications expressly advocating the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate(s) made by a corporation, including a corporation described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or labor organization to its restricted class shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 100.134(a) and 104.6.\n\n(c) Communications containing express advocacy. Communications containing express advocacy which may be made to the restricted class include, but are not limited to, the examples set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.\n\n(1) Publications. Printed material expressly advocating the election or defeat of one or more clearly identified candidate(s) or candidates of a clearly identified political party may be distributed by a corporation or by a labor organization to its restricted class, provided that:\n\n(i) The material is produced at the expense of the corporation or labor organization; and\n\n(ii) The material constitutes a communication of the views of the corporation or the labor organization, and is not the republication or reproduction, in whole or in part, of any broadcast, transcript or tape or any written, graphic, or other form of campaign materials prepared by the candidate, his or her campaign committees, or their authorized agents. A corporation or labor organization may, under this section, use brief quotations from speeches or other materials of a candidate that demonstrate the candidate's position as part of the corporation's or labor organization's expression of its own views.\n\n(2) Candidate and party appearances. (i) A corporation may allow a candidate, candidate's representative or party representative to address its restricted class at a meeting, convention or other function of the corporation, but is not required to do so. A labor organization may allow a candidate or party representative to address its restricted class at a meeting, convention, or other function of the labor organization, but is not required to do so. A corporation or labor organization may bar other candidates for the same office or a different office and their representatives, and representatives of other parties addressing the restricted class. A corporation or labor organization may allow the presence of employees outside the restricted class of the corporation or labor organization who are necessary to administer the meeting, other guests of the corporation or labor organization who are being honored or speaking or participating in the event, and representatives of the news media.\n\n(ii) The candidate, candidate's representative or party representative may ask for contributions to his or her campaign or party, or ask that contributions to the separate segregated fund of the corporation or labor organization be designated for his or her campaign or party. The incidental solicitation of persons outside the corporation's or labor organization's restricted class who may be present at the meeting as permitted by this section will not be a violation of 11 CFR part 114. The candidate's representative or party representative (other than an officer, director or other representative of a corporation or official, member or employee of a labor organization) or the candidate, may accept contributions before, during or after the appearance at the meeting, convention or other function of the corporation or labor organization.\n\n(iii) The corporation or labor organization may suggest that members of its restricted class contribute to the candidate or party committee, but the collection of contributions by any officer, director or other representative of the corporation or labor organization before, during, or after the appearance while at the meeting, is an example of a prohibited facilitation of contributions under 11 CFR 114.2(f).\n\n(iv) If the corporation or labor organization permits more than one candidate for the same office, or more than one candidate's representative or party representative, to address its restricted class, and permits the news media to cover or carry an appearance by one candidate or candidate's representative or party representative, the corporation or labor organization shall also permit the news media to cover or carry the appearances by the other candidate(s) for that office, or the other candidates' representatives or party representatives. If the corporation or labor organization permits a representative of the news media to cover or carry a candidate or candidate's representative or party representative appearance, the corporation or labor organization shall provide all other representatives of the news media with equal access for covering or carrying that appearance. Equal access is provided by—\n\n(A) Providing advance information regarding the appearance to the representatives of the news media whom the corporation or labor organization customarily contacts and other representatives of the news media upon request; and\n\n(B) Allowing all representatives of the news media to cover or carry the appearance, through the use of pooling arrangements if necessary.\n\n(3) Phone banks. A corporation or a labor organization may establish and operate phone banks to communicate with its restricted class, urging them to register and/or vote for a particular candidate or candidates, or to register with a particular political party.\n\n(4) Registration and get-out-the-vote drives. (i) A corporation or labor organization may conduct voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives aimed at its restricted class, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section. Voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives include providing transportation to the place of registration and to the polls. Such drives may include communications containing express advocacy, such as urging individuals to register with a particular party or to vote for a particular candidate or candidates.\n\n(ii) Disbursements for a voter registration or get-out-the-vote drive conducted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section are not contributions or expenditures if the drive is nonpartisan. See 52 U.S.C. 30118(b)(2)(B). A drive is nonpartisan if it is conducted so that information and other assistance regarding registering or voting, including transportation and other services offered, is not withheld or refused on the basis of support for or opposition to particular candidates or a particular political party.\n\n(iii) A corporation or labor organization may make disbursements to conduct voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives that are aimed at its restricted class and that do not qualify as nonpartisan under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, provided that the disbursements do not constitute coordinated expenditures as defined in 11 CFR 109.20, coordinated communications as defined in 11 CFR 109.21, or contributions as defined in 11 CFR part 100, subpart B.

Communications that a corporation or labor organization may make only to its employees (including its restricted class) and their families, but not to the general public, are set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Any communications that a corporation or labor organization may make to the general public under paragraph (c) of this section may also be made to the corporation's or labor organization's restricted class and to other employees and their families. Communications that a corporation or labor organization may make only to its restricted class are set forth at 11 CFR 114.3. The activities described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may be coordinated with candidates and political committees only to the extent permitted by this section. For the otherwise applicable regulations regarding independent expenditures and coordination with candidates, see 11 CFR 100.16, 109.21, and 114.2(c).

The candidate, candidate's representative or party representative shall not accept contributions before, during or after the appearance while at the meeting, convention or other function of the corporation, but may leave campaign materials or envelopes for members of the audience. A corporation, its restricted class, or other employees of the corporation or its separate segregated fund shall not, either orally or in writing, solicit or direct or control contributions by members of the audience to any candidate or party in conjunction with any appearance by any candidate or party representative under this section, and shall not facilitate the making of contributions to any such candidate or party (see 11 CFR 114.2(f));\n\n(v) A corporation or its separate segregated fund shall not, in conjunction with any candidate, candidate representative or party representative appearance under this section, expressly advocate the election or defeat of any clearly identified candidate(s) or candidates of a clearly identified political party and shall not promote or encourage express advocacy by employees;\n\n(vi) No candidate, candidate's representative or party representative shall be provided with more time or a substantially better location than other candidates, candidates' representatives or party representatives who appear, unless the corporation is able to demonstrate that it is clearly impractical to provide all candidates, candidates' representatives and party representatives with similar times or locations;\n\n(vii) Coordination with each candidate, candidate's agent, and candidate's authorized committee(s) may include discussions of the structure, format and timing of the candidate appearance and the candidate's positions on issues, but shall not include discussions of the candidate's plans, projects, or needs relating to the campaign; and\n\n(viii) Representatives of the news media may be allowed to be present during a candidate, candidate representative or party representative appearance under this section, in accordance with the procedures set forth at 11 CFR 114.3(c)(2)(iv).\n\n(2) Candidate and party appearances on labor organization premises or at a meeting, convention or other function.

    "content": "(a) Voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund. (1) A separate segregated fund is prohibited from making a contribution or expenditure by utilizing money or anything of value secured by physical force, job discrimination, financial reprisals, or the threat of force, job discrimination, or financial reprisal; or by dues, fees, or other monies required as a condition of membership in a labor organization or as a condition of employment or by monies obtained in any commercial transaction. For purposes of this section, fees or monies paid as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership or employment are monies required as a condition of membership or employment even though they are refundable upon request of the payor.\n\n(2) A guideline for contributions may be suggested by a corporation or a labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either, provided that the person soliciting or the solicitation informs the persons being solicited—\n\n(i) That the guidelines are merely suggestions; and\n\n(ii) That an individual is free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggest and the corporation or labor organization will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of their contribution or their decision not to contribute.\n\n(3) Any person soliciting an employee or member for a contribution to a separate segregated fund must inform such employee or member of the political purposes of the fund at the time of the solicitation.\n\n(4) Any persons soliciting an employee or member for a contribution to a separate segregated fund must inform the employee or member at the time of such solicitation of his or her right to refuse to so contribute without any reprisal.\n\n(5) Any written solicitation for a contribution to a separate segregated fund which is addressed to an employee or member must contain statements which comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) of this section, and if a guideline is suggested, statements which comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n\n(b) Use of treasury monies. Corporations, labor organizations, membership organizations, cooperatives, or corporations without capital stock may use general treasury monies, including monies obtained in commercial transactions and dues monies or membership fees, for the establishment, administration, and solicitation of contributions to its separate segregated fund. A corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may not use the establishment, administration, and solicitation process as a means of exchanging treasury monies for voluntary contributions.\n\n(1) A contributor may not be paid for his or her contribution through a bonus, expense account, or other form of direct or indirect compensation.\n\n(2) A corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may, subject to the provisions of 39 U.S.C. 3005 and chapter 61, title 18, United States Code, utilize a raffle or other fundraising device which involves a prize, so long as State law permits and the prize is not disproportionately valuable. Dances, parties, and other types of entertainment may also be used as fundraising devices. When using raffles or entertainment to raise funds, a reasonable practice to follow is for the separate segregated fund to reimburse the corporation or labor organization for costs which exceed one-third of the money contributed.\n\n(3) If the separate segregated fund pays any solicitation or other administrative expense from its own account, which expense could be paid for as an administrative expense by the collecting agent, the collecting agent may reimburse the separate segregated fund no later than 30 calendar days after the expense was paid by the separate segregated fund.\n\n(c) Membership in separate segregated funds. (1) A separate segregated fund established by a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock may provide that persons who contribute a certain amount to its separate segregated fund will become members of its separate segregated fund, so long as—\n\n(i) The fund accepts contributions of all amounts, subject to the limitations of part 110;\n\n(ii) Subject to paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, nothing of value may be given in return for or in the course of membership;\n\n(iii) The fund may use membership status for intangible privileges such as allowing members only to choose the candidates to whom the fund will contribute.\n\n(2) The fact that the separate segregated fund of a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock is a membership group does not provide the corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock with any greater right of communication or solicitation than the corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock is otherwise granted under this part.\n\n(d) Control of funds. A corporation, membership organization, cooperative, corporation without capital stock, or labor organization may exercise control over its separate segregated fund.\n\n(e) Disclosure. Separate segregated funds are subject to the following disclosure requirements:\n\n(1) A corporation or labor organization is not required to report any payment made or obligation incurred which is not a contribution or expenditure, as defined in § 114.1(a), except those reporting requirements specifically set forth in this section.\n\n(2) A membership organization or corporation is not required to report the cost of any communication to its members or stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, if such membership organization or corporation is not organized primarily for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any person to Federal office, except that—\n\n(i) The costs incurred by a membership organization, including a labor organization, or by a corporation, directly attributable to a communication expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate (other than a communication primarily devoted to subjects other than the express advocacy of the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate) shall, if those costs exceed $2,000 per election, be reported in accordance with 11 CFR 100.134(a); and\n\n(ii) The amounts paid or incurred for legal or accounting services rendered to or on behalf of a candidate or political committee solely for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Act or chapter 95 or 96 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 paid by a corporation or labor organization which is the regular employer of the individual rendering such services, shall be reported in accordance with the provisions of part 104.\n\n(3) A separate segregated fund is subject to all other disclosure requirements of political committees as set forth in part 104.\n\n(f) Contribution limits. Separate segregated funds are subject to the contribution limitations for political committees set forth in part 110. (See particularly § 110.3).\n\n(g) Solicitations. Except as specifically provided in §§ 114.6, 114.7, and 114.8, a corporation and/or its separate segregated fund or a labor organization and/or its separate segregated fund is subject to the following limitations on solicitations:\n\n(1) A corporation or a separate segregated fund established by a corporation is prohibited from soliciting contributions to such fund from any person other than its stockholders and their families and its executive or administrative personnel and their families. A corporation may solicit the executive or administrative personnel of its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates and their families. For purposes of this section, the factors set forth at 11 CFR 100.5(g)(4) shall be used to determine whether an organization is an affiliate of a corporation.\n\n(2) A labor organization, or a separate segregated fund established by a labor organization is prohibited from soliciting contributions to such a fund from any person other than its members and executive or administrative personnel, and their families.\n\n(h) Accidental or inadvertent solicitation. Accidental or inadvertent solicitation by a corporation or labor organization, or the separate segregated fund of either, of persons apart from and beyond those whom it is permitted to solicit will not be deemed a violation, provided that such corporation or labor organization or separate segregated fund has used its best efforts to comply with the limitations regarding the persons it may solicit and that the method of solicitation is corrected forthwith after the discovery of such erroneous solicitation.\n\n(i) Communications paid for with voluntary contributions. A separate segregated fund may, using voluntary contributions, communicate with the general public, except that such communications may not solicit contributions to a separate segregated fund established by a corporation, labor organization, membership organization, cooperative, or corporation without capital stock, unless such solicitation is permitted under paragraph (g) of this section.\n\n(j) Acceptance of contributions. A separate segregated fund may accept contributions from persons otherwise permitted by law to make contributions.\n\n(k) Availability of methods. Any corporation, including its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates, that uses a method of soliciting voluntary contributions or facilitating the making of voluntary contributions from its stockholders or executive or administrative personnel and their families, shall make that method available to a labor organization representing any members working for the corporation, its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates for soliciting voluntary contributions or facilitating the making of voluntary contributions from its members and their families. Such method shall be made available on the written request of the labor organization and at a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the expenses incurred thereby. For example—\n\n(1) If a corporation, including its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates utilizes a payroll deduction plan, check-off system, or other plan which deducts contributions from the dividend or payroll checks of stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, the corporation shall, upon written request of the labor organization, make that method available to members of the labor organization working for the corporation, its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates, who wish to contribute to the separate segregated fund of the labor organization representing any members working for the corporation, or any of its subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates. The corporation shall make the payroll deduction plan available to the labor organization at a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the actual expenses incurred thereby.\n\n(2) If a corporation uses a computer for addressing envelopes or labels for a solicitation to its stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, the corporation shall, upon written request, program the computer to enable the labor organization to solicit its members. The corporation shall charge the labor organization a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation for the actual expenses incurred in programming the computers and the allocated cost of employee time relating to the work, and the materials used.\n\n(3) If a corporation uses corporate facilities, such as a company dining room or cafeteria, for meetings of stockholders or executive or administrative personnel at which solicitations are made, the corporation shall upon written request of the labor organization allow that labor organization to use existing corporate facilities for meetings to solicit its members. The labor organization shall be required to reimburse the corporation for any actual expenses incurred thereby, such as any increase in the overhead to the corporation and any cost involved in setting up the facilities.\n\n(4) If a corporation uses no method to solicit voluntary contributions or to facilitate the making of voluntary contributions from stockholders or executive or administrative personnel, it is not required by law to make any method available to the labor organization for its members. The corporation and the labor organization may agree upon making any lawful method available even though such agreement is not required by the Act.\n\n(5) The availability of methods of twice yearly solicitations is subject to the provisions of § 114.6(e).\n\n(l) Methods permitted by law to labor organizations. Notwithstanding any other law, any method of soliciting voluntary contributions or of facilitating the making of voluntary contributions to a separate segregated fund established by a corporation, permitted by law to corporations with regard to stockholders and executive or administrative personnel, shall also be permitted to labor organizations with regard to their members and executive or administrative personnel.\n\n[41 FR 35955, Aug. 25, 1976, as amended at 45 FR 21210, Apr. 1, 1980; 48 FR 26303, June 7, 1983; 48 FR 50508, Nov. 2, 1983; 54 FR 34114, Aug. 17, 1989; 54 FR 48580, Nov. 24, 1989; 67 FR 78681, Dec. 26, 2002]",

    "content": "(a) Definition. A trade association is generally a membership organization of persons engaging in a similar or related line of commerce, organized to promote and improve business conditions in that line of commerce and not to engage in a regular business of a kind ordinarily carried on for profit, and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any member.\n\n(b) Prohibition. Nothing in this section waives the prohibition on contributions by corporations which are members of a trade association.\n\n(c) Limitations. A trade association or a separate segregated fund established by a trade association may solicit contributions from the stockholders and executive or administrative personnel of the member corporations of such trade association and the families of such stockholders and personnel if—\n\n(1) The member corporation involved has separately and specifically approved the solicitations; and\n\n(2) The member corporation has not approved a solicitation by any other trade association for the same calendar year.\n\n(d) Separate and specific approval. (1) The member corporation must knowingly and specifically approve any solicitation for a trade association, whether the solicitation is done by the trade association, its separate segregated fund, or the corporation or any of its personnel, for contributions to the trade association's separate segregated fund.\n\n(2) A record of each approved request received by a trade association or its separate segregated fund shall be maintained by the trade association or its fund for three years from the year for which the approval is given.\n\n(3) The request for approval may contain a record of solicitation materials which will be used if approval is granted. Such a solicitation must specifically indicate the requirement of approval and the limitation of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and approval must be granted to the trade association or its separate segregated fund prior to the time any solicitation is made of the stockholders or executive or administrative personnel by the trade association, its separate segregated fund, or by the corporation for contributions to the separate segregated fund of the trade association. (The request for approval may be sent to the representatives of the corporation with whom the trade association normally conducts the association's activities.)\n\n(4) A separate authorization specifically allowing a trade association to solicit its corporate member's stockholders, and executive or administrative personnel applies through the calendar year for which it is designated. A separate authorization by the corporate member must be designated for each year during which the solicitation is to occur. This authorization may be requested and may also be received prior to the calendar year in which the solicitation is to occur.\n\n(5) In its request to a member corporation, a trade association may indicate that it intends to solicit, for example, a limited class of the executive or administrative personnel of the member corporation, or only the executive or administrative personnel but not the stockholders of the member corporation. Moreover, in its approval, a member corporation may similarly limit any solicitation by the trade association or its separate segregated fund. In any event, a member corporation, once it has approved any solicitation—even to a limited extent—of its personnel or stockholders by a trade association or its separate segregated fund, is precluded from approving any such solicitation by another trade association or its separate segregated fund and the corporation and its personnel are precluded from soliciting the corporation's executive or administrative personnel or stockholders on behalf of another trade association or its separate segregated fund.\n\n(e) Solicitation. (1) After a trade association has obtained the approval required in paragraph (c) of this section, there is no limit on the number of times the trade association or its separate segregated fund may solicit the persons approved by the member corporation during the calendar year to which the approval applies. The member corporation may, however, in its approval limit the number of times solicitations may be made.\n\n(2) A member corporation which grants permission to a trade association to solicit is in no way restricted in its rights under § 114.5(g) to solicit its stockholders or executive or administrative personnel and their families for contributions to the corporation's own separate segregated fund.\n\n(3) There is no limitation on the method of soliciting voluntary contributions or the method of facilitating the making of voluntary contributions which a trade association may use.\n\n(4) A corporation may provide incidental services to collect and forward contributions from its employee stockholders and executive and administrative personnel to the separate segregated fund of a trade association of which the corporation is a member, including a payroll deduction or check-off system, upon written request of the trade association. Any corporation that provides such incidental services, and the corporation's subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates, shall make those incidental services available to a labor organization representing any members working for the corporation or the corporation's subsidiaries, branches, divisions, or affiliates, upon written request of the labor organization and at a cost sufficient only to reimburse the corporation or the corporation's subsidiaries, branches, divisions, and affiliates, for the expenses incurred thereby.\n\n(5) A trade association and/or its separate segregated fund is subject to the provisions of § 114.5(a).\n\n(f) Solicitation of a subsidiary corporation. If a parent corporation is a member of the trade association but its subsidiary is not, the trade association or its separate segregated fund may only solicit the parent's executive or administrative personnel and their families and the parent's stockholders and their families; it may not solicit the subsidiary's executive or administrative personnel or stockholders or their families. If a subsidiary is a member of the trade association but the parent corporation is not, the trade association or its separate segregated fund may only solicit the subsidiary's executive or administrative personnel and their families and the subsidiary's stockholders and their families; it may not solicit the parent's executive or administrative personnel or stockholders or their families. If both parent and subsidiary are members of the trade association, the executive or administrative personnel and their families and the stockholders and their families of each may be solicited.\n\n(g) Federations of trade associations. (1) A federation of trade associations is an organization representing trade associations involved in the same or allied line of commerce. Such a federation may, subject to the following limitations, solicit the members of the federation's regional, State or local affiliates or members, provided that all of the political committees established, financed, maintained or controlled by the federation and its regional, State, or local affiliates or members are considered one political committee for the purposes of the limitations in §§ 110.1 and 110.2. The factors set forth at § 100.5(g)(4) shall be used to determine whether an entity is a regional, State or local affiliate of a federation of trade associations.\n\n(i) The federation and its member associations may engage in a joint solicitation; or\n\n(ii) The member association may delegate its solicitation rights to the federation.\n\n(2) A federation is subject to the provisions of this section when soliciting the stockholders and executive or administrative personnel of the corporate members of its member associations.\n\n(h) Communications other than solicitations. A trade association may make communications, other than solicitations, to its members and their families under the provisions of § 114.3. When making communications to a member which is a corporation, the trade association may communicate with the representatives of the corporation with whom the trade association normally conducts the association's activities.\n\n(i) Trade association employees. (1) A trade association may communicate with its executive or administrative personnel and their families under the provisions of § 114.3; a trade association may communicate with its other employees under the provisions of § 114.4.\n\n(2) A trade association may solicit its executive or administrative personnel and their families under the provisions of § 114.5(g); a trade association may solicit its other employees under the provisions of § 114.6.\n\n[41 FR 35955, Aug. 25, 1976, as amended at 48 FR 48650, Oct. 20, 1983; 48 FR 50508, Nov. 2, 1983; 54 FR 10622, Mar. 15, 1989; 54 FR 27154, June 28, 1989, 54 FR 34114, Aug. 17, 1989; 54 FR 48580, Nov. 24, 1989; 55 FR 2281, Jan. 23, 1990; 70 FR 41944, July 21, 2005; 89 FR 218, Jan. 2, 2024]",

Any person who uses the facilities of a corporation or labor organization to produce materials in connection with a Federal election is required to reimburse the corporation or labor organization within a commercially reasonable time for the normal and usual charge for producing such materials in the commercial market.\n\n(d) Use or rental of corporate or labor organization facilities by other persons. Persons, other than those specifically mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, who make any use of corporate or labor organization facilities, such as by using telephones or computers or borrowing office furniture, for activity in connection with a Federal election are required to reimburse the corporation or labor organization within a commercially reasonable time in the amount of the normal and usual rental charge, as defined in 11 CFR 100.52(d)(2), for the use of the facilities.\n\n(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the provisions in 11 CFR Part 114 regarding communications to and beyond a restricted class.\n\n[41 FR 35955, Aug. 25, 1976, as amended at 45 FR 21210, Apr. 1, 1980; 67 FR 78681, 78682, Dec. 26, 2002; 68 FR 69595, Dec. 15, 2003; 71 FR 18614, Apr. 4, 2006; 89 FR 218, Jan. 2, 2024]",

The Commission will review the request to determine whether the ongoing committee and the creditor have complied with the requirements of 11 CFR part 116, and to determine whether reporting the debt as not payable would result in an apparent violation of the Act or the Commission's regulations. The ongoing committee shall continue to disclose the debt on its schedules of outstanding debts and obligations until the Commission has completed its review of the request and has determined that the debt is not payable for purposes of the Act.\n\n(d) Reporting. Upon notification that the Commission has determined that the debt is not payable for purposes of the Act, the political committee may list the debt as not payable on the next due report. Notwithstanding 11 CFR 104.11, the debt does not have to be included in subsequent reports unless the status of the debt changes. The presence of a debt that the Commission has determined is not payable shall not bar the political committee from terminating its registration pursuant to 11 CFR 102.3.\n\n[55 FR 26386, June 27, 1990, as amended at 89 FR 218, Jan. 2, 2024]",

On or after November 6, 2002, an entity shall not be deemed to be directly or indirectly established, maintained, or controlled by another entity unless, based on the entities' actions and activities solely after November 6, 2002, they satisfy the requirements of this section. If an entity receives funds from another entity prior to November 6, 2002, and the recipient entity disposes of the funds prior to November 6, 2002, the receipt of such funds prior to November 6, 2002 shall have no bearing on determining whether the recipient entity is financed by the sponsoring entity within the meaning of this section.\n\n(4) Determinations by the Commission. (i) A sponsor or entity may request an advisory opinion of the Commission to determine whether the sponsor is no longer directly or indirectly financing, maintaining, or controlling the entity for purposes of this part. The request for such an advisory opinion must meet the requirements of 11 CFR part 112 and must demonstrate that the entity is not directly or indirectly financed, maintained, or controlled by the sponsor.\n\n(ii) Notwithstanding the fact that a sponsor may have established an entity within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the sponsor or the entity may request an advisory opinion of the Commission determining that the relationship between the sponsor and the entity has been severed. The request for such an advisory opinion must meet the requirements of 11 CFR part 112, and must demonstrate that all material connections between the sponsor and the entity have been severed for two years.\n\n(iii) Nothing in this section shall require entities that are separate organizations on November 6, 2002 to obtain an advisory opinion to operate separately from each other.\n\n(d) Disbursement. Disbursement means any purchase or payment made by:\n\n(1) A political committee; or\n\n(2) Any other person, including an organization that is not a political committee, that is subject to the Act.\n\n(e) Donation. For purposes of part 300, donation means a payment, gift, subscription, loan, advance, deposit, or anything of value given to a person, but does not include contributions.\n\n(f) Federal account. Federal account means an account at a campaign depository that contains funds to be used in connection with a Federal election.\n\n(g) Federal Funds. Federal funds mean funds that comply with the limitations, prohibitions, and reporting requirements of the Act.\n\n(h) Levin account. Levin account means an account at a campaign depository established by a State, district, or local committee of a political party pursuant to 11 CFR 300.30, for purposes of making expenditures or disbursements for Federal election activity or non-Federal activity (subject to State law) under 11 CFR 300.32.\n\n(i) Levin funds mean funds that are raised pursuant to 11 CFR 300.31 and are or will be disbursed pursuant to 11 CFR 300.32.\n\n(j) Non-Federal account means an account that contains funds to be used in connection with a State or local election or allocable expenses under 11 CFR 106.7, 300.30, or 300.33.\n\n(k) Non-Federal funds mean funds that are not subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the Act.\n\n(l) [Reserved]\n\n(m) To solicit. For the purposes of part 300, to solicit means to ask, request, or recommend, explicitly or implicitly, that another person make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value. A solicitation is an oral or written communication that, construed as reasonably understood in the context in which it is made, contains a clear message asking, requesting, or recommending that another person make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value. A solicitation may be made directly or indirectly. The context includes the conduct of persons involved in the communication. A solicitation does not include mere statements of political support or mere guidance as to the applicability of a particular law or regulation.\n\n(1) The following types of communications constitute solicitations:\n\n(i) A communication that provides a method of making a contribution or donation, regardless of the communication. This includes, but is not limited to, providing a separate card, envelope, or reply device that contains an address to which funds may be sent and allows contributors or donors to indicate the dollar amount of their contribution or donation to the candidate, political committee, or other organization.\n\n(ii) A communication that provides instructions on how or where to send contributions or donations, including providing a phone number specifically dedicated to facilitating the making of contributions or donations. However, a communication does not, in and of itself, satisfy the definition of “to solicit” merely because it includes a mailing address or phone number that is not specifically dedicated to facilitating the making of contributions or donations.\n\n(iii) A communication that identifies a website address where the web page displayed is specifically dedicated to facilitating the making of a contribution or donation, or automatically redirects the Internet user to such a page, or exclusively displays a link to such a page. However, a communication does not, in and of itself, satisfy the definition of “to solicit” merely because it includes the address of a web page that is not specifically dedicated to facilitating the making of a contribution or donation.\n\n(2) The following statements constitute solicitations:\n\n(i) “Please give $100,000 to Group X.”\n\n(ii) “It is important for our State party to receive at least $100,000 from each of you in this election.”\n\n(iii) “Group X has always helped me financially in my elections. Keep them in mind this fall.”\n\n(iv) “X is an effective State party organization; it needs to obtain as many $100,000 donations as possible.”\n\n(v) “Giving $100,000 to Group X would be a very smart idea.”\n\n(vi) “Send all contributions to the following address * * *.”\n\n(vii) “I am not permitted to ask for contributions, but unsolicited contributions will be accepted at the following address * * *.”\n\n(viii) “Group X is having a fundraiser this week; you should go.”\n\n(ix) “You have reached the limit of what you may contribute directly to my campaign, but you can further help my campaign by assisting the State party.”\n\n(x) A candidate hands a potential donor a list of people who have contributed to a group and the amounts of their contributions. The candidate says, “I see you are not on the list.”\n\n(xi) “I will not forget those who contribute at this crucial stage.”\n\n(xii) “The candidate will be very pleased if we can count on you for $10,000.”\n\n(xiii) “Your contribution to this campaign would mean a great deal to the entire party and to me personally.”\n\n(xiv) Candidate says to potential donor: “The money you will help us raise will allow us to communicate our message to the voters through Labor Day.”\n\n(xv) “I appreciate all you've done in the past for our party in this State. Looking ahead, we face some tough elections. I'd be very happy if you could maintain the same level of financial support for our State party this year.”\n\n(xvi) The head of Group X solicits a contribution from a potential donor in the presence of a candidate. The donor asks the candidate if the contribution to Group X would be a good idea and would help the candidate's campaign. The candidate nods affirmatively.\n\n(3) The following statements do not constitute solicitations:\n\n(i) During a policy speech, the candidate says: “Thank you for your support of the Democratic Party.”\n\n(ii) At a ticket-wide rally, the candidate says: “Thank you for your support of my campaign.”\n\n(iii) At a Labor Day rally, the candidate says: “Thank you for your past financial support of the Republican Party.”\n\n(iv) At a GOTV rally, the candidate says: “Thank you for your continuing support.”\n\n(v) At a ticket-wide rally, the candidate says: “It is critical that we support the entire Democratic ticket in November.”\n\n(vi) A Federal officeholder says: “Our Senator has done a great job for us this year. The policies she has vigorously promoted in the Senate have really helped the economy of the State.”\n\n(vii) A candidate says: “Thanks to your contributions we have been able to support our President, Senator and Representative during the past election cycle.”\n\n(n) To direct. For the purposes of part 300, to direct means to guide, directly or indirectly, a person who has expressed an intent to make a contribution, donation, transfer of funds, or otherwise provide anything of value, by identifying a candidate, political committee or organization, for the receipt of such funds, or things of value. The contribution, donation, transfer, or thing of value may be made or provided directly or through a conduit or intermediary. Direction does not include merely providing information or guidance as to the applicability of a particular law or regulation.\n\n(o) Individual holding Federal office. Individual holding Federal office means an individual elected to or serving in the office of President or Vice President of the United States; or a Senator or a Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the Congress of the United States.\n\n[67 FR 49120, July 29, 2002, as amended at 67 FR 78682, Dec. 26, 2002; 71 FR 13933, Mar. 20, 2006; 89 FR 219, Jan. 2, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) Scope and introduction. This section applies to State, district, or local committees or organizations of a political party, whether or not the committee is a political committee under 11 CFR 100.5, that have receipts or make disbursements for Federal election activity. Paragraph (b) of this section describes and explains the types of accounts available to a political party committee or organization covered by this section. Paragraph (c) of this section sets out the account structure that must be maintained by a political party committee or organization covered by this section.\n\n(b) Types of accounts. Each State, district, and local party organization or committee that has receipts or makes disbursements for Federal election activity must establish one or more of the following types of accounts, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(1) Non-Federal accounts. The funds deposited into this account are governed by State law. Disbursements, contributions, and expenditures made wholly or in part in connection with Federal elections must not be made from any non-Federal account, except as permitted by paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, 11 CFR 102.5(a)(4), 11 CFR 106.7(d)(1)(i), 11 CFR 300.33 and 11 CFR 300.34.\n\n(2) Levin account.

At the discretion of the party committee or organization, separate allocation accounts may be established for purposes of making allocable expenditures and disbursements.\n\n(i) Only funds from the party organization's or committee's Federal and non-Federal accounts may be deposited into an allocation account used to make allocable expenditures and disbursements for activities in connection with Federal and non-Federal elections.\n\n(ii) Only funds from the party organization's or committee's Federal account and Levin funds from its non-Federal or Levin account(s) may be deposited into an allocation account used to make allocable expenditures and disbursements for activities undertaken pursuant to 11 CFR 300.32(b).\n\n(iii) Once a party organization or committee has established a separate allocation account for activities in connection with Federal and non-Federal elections and a separate account for activities undertaken pursuant to 11 CFR 300.32(b), all allocable expenses must be paid from the appropriate allocation account for as long as that account is maintained.\n\n(iv) The party organization or committee must transfer to the appropriate allocation account funds from its Federal and non-Federal or Levin accounts in amounts proportionate to the Federal, non-Federal and Levin shares of each allocable expense pursuant to 11 CFR 106.7 and 11 CFR 300.33.

State, district, and local party organizations or committees may choose to make non-Federal disbursements, subject to State law, and disbursements for Federal election activity from a Federal account provided that such disbursements are reported pursuant to 11 CFR 104.17 and 11 CFR 300.36, and provided that contributors of the Federal funds so used were notified that their contributions were subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the Act.\n\n(2) Establish at least three separate accounts in depositories as follows—\n\n(i) One or more Federal accounts;\n\n(ii) One or more Levin accounts; and\n\n(iii) One or more Non-Federal accounts.\n\n(3) Establish two separate accounts in depositories as follows:\n\n(i) One or more Federal accounts, and;\n\n(ii) An account that must function as both a Non-Federal account and a Levin account. If such an account is used, the State, district, and local party must demonstrate through a reasonable accounting method approved by the Commission (including any method embedded in software provided or approved by the Commission) that whenever such organization makes a disbursement for activities undertaken pursuant to 11 CFR 300.32(b), that organization had received sufficient contributions or Levin funds to make such disbursement.\n\n(d) Recordkeeping. All party organizations or committees must keep records of deposits into and disbursements from such accounts, and, upon request, must make such records available for examination by the Commission.",

    "content": "(a) General rule. Levin funds expended or disbursed by any State, district, or local committee must be raised solely by the committee that expends or disburses them.\n\n(b) Compliance with State law. Each donation of Levin funds solicited or accepted by a State, district, or local committee of a political party must be lawful under the laws of the State in which the committee is organized.\n\n(c) Donations from sources permitted by State law but prohibited by the Act. If the laws of the State in which a State, district, or local committee of a political party is organized permit donations to the committee from a source prohibited by the Act and this chapter, other than 52 U.S.C. 30121, the committee may solicit and accept donations of Levin funds from that source, subject to paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(d) Donation amount limitation—(1) General rule. A State, district, or local committee of a political party must not solicit or accept from any person (including any entity established, financed, maintained, or controlled by such person) one or more donations of Levin funds aggregating more than $10,000 in a calendar year.\n\n(2) Effect of different State limitations. If the laws of the State in which a State, district, or local committee of a political party is organized limit donations to that committee to less than the amount specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, then the State law amount limitations shall control. If the laws of the State in which a State, district, or local committee of a political party is organized permit donations to that committee in amounts greater than the amount specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, then the amount limitations in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall control.\n\n(3) No affiliation of committees for purposes of this paragraph. For purposes of determining compliance with paragraph (d) of this section only, State, district, and local committees of the same political party shall not be considered affiliated. Subject to the amount limitations specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, a person (including any entity directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled by such person) may donate without additional limitation to each and every State, district, and local committee of a political party.\n\n(e) No Levin funds from a national party committee or a Federal candidate or officeholder. A State, district, or local committee of a political party disbursing Levin funds pursuant to 11 CFR 300.32 must not accept or use for such purposes any donations or other funds that are solicited, received, directed, transferred, or spent by or in the name of any of the following persons:\n\n(1) A national committee of a political party (including a national congressional campaign committee of a political party), any officer or agent acting on behalf of such a national party committee, or any entity that is directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled by such a national party committee. Notwithstanding 11 CFR 102.17, a State, district, or local committee of a political party must not raise Levin funds by means of joint fundraising with a national committee of a political party, any officer or agent acting on behalf of such a national party committee, or any entity that is directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled by such a national party committee. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a State, district, or local committee of a political party from jointly raising, under 11 CFR 102.17, Federal funds not to be used for Federal election activity with a national committee of a political party, or its agent, or any entity directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled by such a national party committee.\n\n(2) A Federal candidate, or an individual holding Federal office, or an agent of a Federal candidate or officeholder, or an entity directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled by, or acting on behalf of, one or more Federal candidates or individuals holding Federal office. Notwithstanding 11 CFR 102.17, a State, district, or local committee of a political party must not raise Levin funds by means of joint fundraising with a Federal candidate, an individual holding Federal office, or an entity directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled by, or acting on behalf of, one or more candidates or individuals holding Federal office. A Federal candidate or individual holding Federal office may attend, speak, or be a featured guest at a fundraising event for a State, district, or local committee of a political party at which Levin funds are raised. See 11 CFR 300.64.\n\n(f) Certain joint fundraising prohibited. Notwithstanding 11 CFR 102.17, a State, district, or local committee of a political party must not raise Levin funds by means of any joint fundraising activity with any other State, district, or local committee of any political party, the agent of such a committee, or an entity directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled by such a committee. This prohibition includes State, district, and local committees of a political party organized in another State. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit two or more State, district, or local committees of a political party from jointly raising, under 11 CFR 102.17, Federal funds not to be used for Federal election activity.\n\n(g) Safe Harbor. The use of a common vendor for fundraising by more than one State, district, or local committee of a political party, or the agent of such a committee, does not constitute joint fundraising within the meaning of this section.\n\n[67 FR 49120, July 29, 2002, as amended at 75 FR 32, Jan. 4, 2010; 79 FR 77850, Dec. 29, 2014]",

For the purchase or construction of its office building, a State or local party committee may spend Federal funds or non-Federal funds that are not subject to the limitations, prohibitions, and disclosure provisions of the Act, so long as such funds are not contributed or donated by a foreign national. See 52 U.S.C. 30121. If non-Federal funds are used, they are subject to State law. An office building must not be purchased or constructed for the purpose of influencing the election of any candidate in any particular election for Federal office. For purposes of this section, the term local party committee shall include a district party committee.\n\n(b) Application of State law. Non-Federal funds received by a State or local party committee that are spent for the purchase or construction of its office building are subject to State law as set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.\n\n(1) Non-Federal account. If a State or local party committee uses non-Federal funds, Federal law does not preempt or supersede State law as to the source of funds used, the permissibility of the disbursements, or the reporting of the receipt and disbursement of such funds, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n(2) Levin funds. Levin funds may be used for the purchase or construction of a State or local party committee office building, if permitted by State law.\n\n(c) Leasing a portion of the party office building. A State or local party committee may lease a portion of its office building to others to generate income at the usual and normal charge. If the building is purchased or constructed in whole or in part with non-Federal funds, all rental income shall be deposited in the committee's non-Federal account and used only for non-Federal purposes. Such rental income and its use must also comply with State law. If the building is purchased or constructed solely with Federal funds, the rental income may be deposited in the Federal account. The receipt of such funds shall be reported in compliance with 11 CFR 104.3(a)(4)(vi).\n\n(d) Transitional Provisions for State Party Building or Facility Account. Up to and including November 5, 2002, the State committee of a political party may accept funds into its party office building or facility account, established pursuant to repealed 2 U.S.C. 431(8)(B)(viii), designated for the purchase or construction of an office building.

    "content": "(a) Requirements for a State, district, or local committee of a political party, or an association or similar group of candidates for State or local office or of individuals holding State or local office, that is not a political committee. (1) A State, district, or local committee of a political party, or an association or similar group of candidates for State or local office or of individuals holding State or local office, that is not a political committee (see 11 CFR 100.5) must demonstrate through a reasonable accounting method that whenever it makes a payment of Federal funds or Levin funds (if it is permitted to spend Levin funds) for Federal election activity (see 11 CFR 300.32 and 300.33) it has received sufficient funds subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the Act to make the payment. Such an organization must keep records of amounts received or expended under this paragraph and, upon request, shall make such records available for examination by the Commission.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a payment of Federal funds or Levin funds for Federal election activity shall not constitute an expenditure for purposes of determining whether a State, district, or local committee of a political party, or an association or similar group of candidates for State or local office or of individuals holding State or local office, qualifies as a political committee under 11 CFR 100.5, unless the payment otherwise qualifies as an expenditure under 52 U.S.C. 30101(9). A payment of Federal funds for Federal election activity that refers to a clearly identified Federal candidate and that meets the criteria of 11 CFR 100.140, 100.147, or 100.149 (exempt activities) shall be treated as a payment for exempt activity in accordance with all applicable provisions of this chapter, including, but not limited to, 52 U.S.C. 30121.\n\n(b) Requirements for a State, district, or local committee of a political party, or an association or similar group of candidates for State or local office or of individuals holding State or local office, that is a political committee—(1) Requirements for a State, district, or local committee of a political party that has less than $5,000 of aggregate receipts and disbursements for Federal election activity in a calendar year, and for an association or similar group of candidates for State or local office or of individuals holding State or local office at all times. This paragraph applies to a State, district, or local committee of a political party that is a political committee, and that has less than $5,000 of aggregate receipts and disbursements for Federal election activity in a calendar year; and, at all times, to an association or similar group of candidates for State or local office or of individuals holding State or local office that is a political committee (see 11 CFR 100.5). Such a party committee or association of candidates or officeholders must report all receipts and disbursements of Federal funds for Federal election activity, including the Federally allocated portion of a payment for Federal election activity. A disbursement of Federal funds or Levin funds for Federal election activity (see 11 CFR 300.32 and 300.33) by either such a party committee or association of candidates or officeholders shall not be deemed an expenditure and reported as such pursuant to 11 CFR part 104, unless the disbursement otherwise qualifies as an expenditure under 2 U.S.C. 431(9).\n\n(2) Requirements for a State, district, or local committee of a political party that has $5,000 or more of aggregate receipts and disbursements for Federal election activity in a calendar year. A State, district, or local committee of a political party that is a political committee (see 11 CFR 100.5) must report all receipts and disbursements made for Federal election activity if the aggregate amount of such receipts and disbursements is $5,000 or more during the calendar year. The disclosure required by this paragraph must include receipts and disbursements of Federal funds and of Levin funds used for Federal election activity.\n\n(i) Reporting of allocation of expenses between Federal funds and Levin funds. A State, district, or local committee of a political party that makes a disbursement for Federal election activity that is allocated between Federal funds and Levin funds (see 11 CFR 300.33) must report for each such disbursement:\n\n(A) In the first report of a calendar year disclosing an allocated disbursement for Federal election activity, the committee must state the allocation percentages to be applied for allocable Federal election activity pursuant to 11 CFR 300.33(b).\n\n(B) In each subsequent report in the calendar year itemizing an allocated disbursement for Federal election activity, the committee must state the category of Federal election activity (see 11 CFR 100.24(b)) for which each allocated disbursement was made, and must disclose the total amounts disbursed from Federal funds and Levin funds for that year to date for each such category.\n\n(ii) Reporting of allocation transfers. A committee that makes allocated disbursements for Federal election activities in accordance with 11 CFR 300.33(e) shall report each transfer of Levin funds from its Levin or non-Federal account, to its Federal account, and each transfer from its Federal account and its Levin or non-Federal account into an allocation account, for the purpose of making such disbursements. In the report covering the period in which each transfer occurred, the committee must explain in a memo entry the allocated disbursement to which the transfer relates and the date on which the transfer was made. If the transfer includes funds for the allocable costs of more than one category of Federal election activity, the committee must itemize the transfer, showing the amounts designated for each category.\n\n(iii) Reporting of allocated disbursements. For each disbursement allocated between Federal funds and Levin funds, the committee must report the full name and address of each person to whom the disbursement was made, the date of the disbursement, amount, and purpose of the disbursement. If the disbursement is for the allocable costs of more than one category of Federal election activity, the committee must itemize the disbursement, showing the amounts designated for each category. The committee must also disclose the total amount disbursed from Federal funds and Levin funds for Federal election activity that calendar year, to date, for each category of Federal election activity.\n\n(iv) Itemization. The disclosure required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section must include, in addition to any other applicable reporting requirement of this chapter, the itemized disclosure of receipts and disbursements of $200 or more to or from any person for Federal election activities.\n\n(3) Reporting of disbursements allocated between Federal funds and non-Federal funds, other than Levin funds. A State, district, or local committee of a political party that makes a disbursement for costs allocable between Federal and non-Federal funds, other than the costs of Federal election activity that is allocated between Federal funds and Levin funds under 11 CFR 300.33, must comply with 11 CFR 104.17.\n\n(c) Filing—(1) Schedule. A State, district, or local committee of a political party, or an association or similar group of candidates for State or local office or of individuals holding State or local office, that must file reports under paragraph (b) of this section must comply with the monthly filing schedule in 11 CFR 104.5(c)(3).\n\n(2) Electronic filing. Receipts of Federal funds for Federal election activity that constitute contributions under 11 CFR part 100, subpart B, and disbursements of Federal funds for Federal election activity that constitute expenditures under 11 CFR part 100, subpart D, apply when determining whether a political committee must file reports in an electronic format under 11 CFR 104.18.\n\n(d) Recordkeeping. A State, district, or local committee of a political party, or an association or similar group of candidates for State or local office or of individuals holding State or local office, that must file reports under paragraph (b) of this section must comply with the requirements of 11 CFR 104.14.\n\n[67 FR 49120, July 29, 2002, as amended at 67 FR 78682, Dec. 26, 2002; 70 FR 75385, Dec. 20, 2005; 79 FR 77850, Dec. 29, 2014]",

The allocation shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the costs associated with each computer function, such as the costs for data entry services performed by persons other than committee personnel and processing time. The candidate shall keep detailed records to support such calculations. The records shall indicate which computer functions are considered compliance-related and shall reflect which costs are associated with each computer function.\n\n(F) The Commission's Financial Control and Compliance Manual for General Election Candidates Receiving Public Funding contains some accepted alternative allocation methods for determining the amount of salaries and overhead expenditures that may be considered exempt compliance costs.\n\n(G) Reimbursement from the GELAC may be made to the separate account maintained for federal funds under 11 CFR 9005.2 for legal and accounting compliance services disbursements that are initially paid from the separate federal funds account.

    "content": "(a) Qualified campaign expenses. An eligible candidate shall use payments received under 11 CFR part 9005 only for the following purposes:\n\n(1) To defray qualified campaign expenses;\n\n(2) To repay loans that meet the requirements of 11 CFR 100.52(b) or 100.82 or to otherwise restore funds (other than contributions received pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.3 (b) or (c) and expended to defray qualified campaign expenses) used to defray qualified campaign expenses;\n\n(3) To restore funds expended in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.4 for qualified campaign expenses incurred by the candidate prior to the beginning of the expenditure report period;\n\n(4) To defray winding down costs pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.11;\n\n(5) To defray costs associated with the candidate's general election campaign paid after the end of the expenditure report period, but incurred by the candidate prior to the end of the expenditure report period, for which written arrangement or commitment was made on or before the close of the expenditure report period for goods and services received during the expenditure reporting period; and\n\n(6) Monetary bonuses paid after the date of the election and gifts shall be considered qualified campaign expenses, provided that:\n\n(i) All monetary bonuses paid after the date of the election for committee employees and consultants in recognition of campaign-related activities or services:\n\n(A) Are provided for pursuant to a written contract made prior to the date of the election; and\n\n(B) Are paid during the expenditure report period; and\n\n(ii) Gifts for committee employees, consultants and volunteers in recognition of campaign-related activities or services do not exceed $150 total per individual and the total of all gifts does not exceed $20,000.\n\n(b) Non-qualified campaign expenses—(1) General. The following are examples of disbursements that are not qualified campaign expenses.\n\n(2) Excessive expenditures. An expenditure which is in excess of any of the limitations under 11 CFR 9003.2 shall not be considered a qualified campaign expense. The Commission will calculate the amount of expenditures attributable to these limitations using the full amounts originally charged for goods and services rendered to the committee and not the amounts for which such obligations were later settled and paid, unless the committee can demonstrate that the lower amount paid reflects a reasonable settlement of a bona fide dispute with the creditor.\n\n(3) Expenditures incurred after the close of the expenditure report period. Except for accounts payable pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this section and winding down costs pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.11, any expenditures incurred after the close of the expenditure report period, as defined in 11 CFR 9002.12, are not qualified campaign expenses.\n\n(4) Civil or criminal penalties.

Additional amounts may be received and expended to pay such penalties, if necessary. These funds shall not be considered contributions or expenditures but all amounts so received shall be subject to the prohibitions of the Act.

Any expenses incurred by a major party candidate to solicit contributions to a legal and accounting compliance fund established pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.3(a) are not qualified campaign expenses and cannot be defrayed from payments received under 11 CFR part 9005.\n\n(6) Payments to candidate.

Payments, including transfers, contributions and loans, to other committees authorized by the same candidate for a different election are not qualified campaign expenses.\n\n(8) Lost, misplaced, or stolen items. The cost of lost, misplaced, or stolen items may be considered a nonqualified campaign expense. Factors considered by the Commission in making this determination shall include, but not be limited to, whether the committee demonstrates that it made conscientious efforts to safeguard the missing equipment; whether the committee sought or obtained insurance on the items; whether the committee filed a police report; the type of equipment involved; and the number and value of items that were lost.\n\n[56 FR 35919, July 29, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 31875, June 16, 1995; 64 FR 49362, Sept. 13, 1999; 67 FR 78683, Dec. 26, 2002; 68 FR 47415, Aug. 8, 2003]",

Expenses for which the committee receives no reimbursement will be considered qualified campaign expenses, and, with the exception of those expenses relating to Secret Service personnel and national security staff, will be subject to the overall expenditure limitation.\n\n(3) Committees may seek reimbursement from the media only for the billable items specified in the White House Press Corps Travel Policies and Procedures issued by the White House Travel Office.\n\n(b) Reimbursement limits; billing. (1) The amount of reimbursement sought from a media representative under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not exceed 110% of the media representative's pro rata share (or a reasonable estimate of the media representative's pro rata share) of the actual cost of the transportation and services made available.

For purposes of this calculation, the total number of individuals shall include committee staff, media personnel, Secret Service personnel, national security staff and any other individuals to whom such transportation and services are made available, except that, when seeking reimbursement for transportation costs paid by the committee under 11 CFR 9004.7(b)(5)(i), the total number of individuals shall not include national security staff.\n\n(3) No later than sixty (60) days of the campaign trip or event, the committee shall provide each media representative attending the event with an itemized bill that specifies the amounts charged for air and ground transportation for each segment of the trip, housing, meals, telephone and internet service, and other billable items specified in the White House Press Corps Travel Policies and Procedures issued by the White House Travel Office. Payments shall be due sixty (60) days from the date of the bill, unless the media representative disputes the charges.\n\n(c) Deduction of reimbursements from expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation. (1) The committee may deduct from the amount of expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation:\n\n(i) The amount of reimbursements received from media representatives in payment for the transportation and services described in paragraph (a) of this section, up to the actual cost of the transportation and services provided to media representatives; and\n\n(ii) An additional amount of the reimbursements received from media representatives, representing the administrative costs incurred by the committee in providing these services to the media representative and seeking reimbursement for them, equal to:\n\n(A) Three percent of the actual cost of transportation and services provided to the media representatives under this section; or\n\n(B) An amount in excess of 3% representing the administrative costs actually incurred by the committee in providing services to the media representatives, provided that the committee is able to document the total amount of administrative costs actually incurred.\n\n(2) For the purpose of this paragraph, “administrative costs” includes all costs incurred by the committee in making travel arrangements and seeking reimbursement, whether these services are performed by committee staff or by independent contractors.\n\n(d) Disposal of excess reimbursements. If the committee receives reimbursements in excess of the amount deductible under paragraph (c) of this section, it shall dispose of the excess amount in the following manner:\n\n(1) Any reimbursement received in excess of 110% of the actual pro rata cost of the transportation and services made available to a media representative shall be returned to the media representative.\n\n(2) Any amount in excess of the amount deductible under paragraph (c) of this section that is not required to be returned to the media representative under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be paid to the Treasury.\n\n(e) Reporting. The total amount paid by an authorized committee for the services and facilities described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, plus the administrative costs incurred by the committee in providing these services and facilities and seeking reimbursement for them, shall be reported as an expenditure in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(b)(2)(i).

Such portion shall be determined by calculating what the trip would have cost from the point of origin of the trip to the first campaign-related stop and from the stop through each subsequent campaign-related stop to the point of origin. If any campaign activity, other than incidental contacts, is conducted at a stop, that stop shall be considered campaign-related. Campaign activity includes soliciting, making, or accepting contributions, and expressly advocating the election or defeat of the candidate. Other factors, including the setting, timing and statements or expressions of the purpose of an event, and the substance of the remarks or speech made, will also be considered in determining whether a stop is campaign-related.\n\n(3) For each trip, an itinerary shall be prepared and such itinerary shall be made available by the committee for Commission inspection. The itinerary shall show the time of arrival and departure and the type of events held.\n\n(4) For trips by government conveyance or by charter, a list of all passengers on such trip, along with a designation of which passengers are and which are not campaign-related, shall be made available for Commission inspection.

For travel by other conveyances, the committee shall maintain records of the commercial rental rate as required by 11 CFR 100.93(j)(3) in addition to any other records required in this section.\n\n(6) Travel expenses of a candidate's spouse and family when accompanying the candidate on campaign-related travel may be treated as qualified campaign expenses and reportable expenditures. If the spouse or family members conduct campaign-related activities, their travel expenses shall be qualified campaign expenses and reportable expenditures.\n\n(7) If any individual, including a candidate, incurs expenses for campaign-related travel, other than by use of government conveyance or accommodations, an amount equal to that portion of the actual cost of the conveyance or accommodations which is allocable to all passengers, including the candidate, who are traveling for campaign purposes shall be a qualified campaign expense and shall be reported by the committee as an expenditure.\n\n(i) If the trip is by charter, the actual cost for each passenger shall be determined by dividing the total operating cost for the charter by the total number of passengers transported. The amount which is a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9004.7(b)(2) on the basis of the actual cost per passenger multiplied by the number of passengers traveling for campaign purposes.\n\n(ii) If the trip is by non-charter commercial transportation, the actual cost shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9004.7(b)(2) on the basis of the commercial fare. Such actual cost shall be a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure.\n\n(8) Non-commercial travel, as defined in 11 CFR 100.93(a)(3)(v), on aircraft, and travel on other means of transportation not operated for commercial passenger service, is governed by 11 CFR 100.93.\n\n[60 FR 31876, June 16, 1995, as amended at 68 FR 69595, Dec. 15, 2003; 74 FR 63967, Dec. 7, 2009; 89 FR 219, Jan. 2, 2024]",

This breakdown shall include estimated costs for office space rental, staff salaries, legal expenses, accounting expenses, office supplies, equipment rental, telephone expenses, postage and other mailing costs, printing and storage. The breakdown shall estimate the costs that will be incurred in each category from the time the statement is submitted until the expected termination of the committee's political activity.\n\n(b) All candidates. Each candidate, except for individuals who have withdrawn pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.8, shall submit a statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses no later than 30 calendar days after the end of the expenditure report period. The statement shall contain the information required by 11 CFR 9004.9(a) (1) and (2), except that the amount of outstanding obligations under 11 CFR 9004.9(a)(1)(i) and the amount of cash on hand, assets and receivables under 11 CFR 9004.9(a)(2) shall be complete as of the last day of the expenditure report period.\n\n(c) Candidates who withdraw. An individual who ceases to be a candidate pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.8 shall file a statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses no later than 30 calendar days after he or she ceases to be a candidate.

(i) For purposes of this section, the term capital asset means any property used in the operation of the campaign whose purchase price exceeded $2000 when acquired by the committee. Property that must be valued as capital assets under this section includes, but is not limited to, office equipment, furniture, vehicles and fixtures acquired for use in the operation of the candidate's campaign, but does not include property defined as “other assets” under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Capital assets include items such as computer systems and telecommunications systems, if the equipment is used together and if the total cost of all components that are used together exceeds $2000. A list of all capital assets shall be maintained by the committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.5(d)(1). The fair market value of capital assets shall be considered to be 60% of the total original cost of such items when acquired, except that items received after the end of the expenditure report period must be valued at their fair market value on the date acquired. A candidate may claim a lower fair market value for a capital asset by listing that capital asset on the statement separately and demonstrating, through records, the lower fair market value.\n\n(ii) If capital assets are obtained from the candidate's primary election committee, the purchase price shall be considered to be 60% of the original cost of such assets to the candidate's primary election committee. For purposes of the statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses filed after the end of the expenditure report period, the fair market value of capital assets obtained from the candidate's primary election committee shall be considered to be 20% of the original cost of such assets to the candidate's primary election committee.\n\n(iii) Items purchased from the primary election committee that are not capital assets, and also are not other assets under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, shall be listed on an inventory that states their valuation.\n\n(2) Other assets. The term other assets means any property acquired by the committee for use in raising funds or as collateral for campaign loans. “Other assets” must be included on the candidate's statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses if the aggregate value of such assets exceeds $5000. The value of “other assets” shall be determined by the fair market value of each item on the last day of the expenditure report period or the day on which the individual ceased to be a candidate, whichever is earlier, unless the item is acquired after these dates, in which case the item shall be valued on the date it is acquired. A list of other assets shall be maintained by the committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.5(d)(2).\n\n(e) Collectibility of accounts receivable. If the committee determines that an account receivable of $500 or more, including any credit, refund, return or rebate, is not collectible in whole or in part, the committee shall demonstrate through records that the determination was commercially reasonable. The records shall include records showing the original amount of the account receivable, copies of correspondence and memoranda of communications with the debtor showing attempts to collect the amount due, and an explanation of how the lesser amount or full write-off was determined.\n\n(f) Review of candidate statement—(1) General. The Commission will review the statement filed by each candidate under this section. The Commission may request further information with respect to statements filed pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.9(b) during the audit of that candidate's authorized committee(s) under 11 CFR part 9007.\n\n(2) Candidate eligible for post-election funding. (i) If, in reviewing the preliminary statement of a candidate eligible to receive post-election funding, the Commission receives information indicating that substantial assets of that candidate's authorized committee(s) have been undervalued or not included in the statement or that the amount of outstanding qualified campaign expenses has been otherwise overstated in relation to committee assets, the Commission may decide to temporarily postpone its certification of funds to that candidate pending a final determination of whether the candidate is entitled to all or a portion of the funds for which he or she is eligible based on the percentage of votes the candidate received in the general election.\n\n(ii) Initial determination. In making a determination under 11 CFR 9004.9(f)(2)(i), the Commission will notify the candidate within 10 business days after its receipt of the statement of its initial determination that the candidate is not entitled to receive the full amount for which the candidate may be eligible. The notice will give the legal and factual reasons for the initial determination and advise the candidate of the evidence on which the Commission's initial determination is based. The candidate will be given the opportunity to revise the statement or to submit, within 10 business days, written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that the candidate has net outstanding qualified campaign expenses that entitle the candidate to post-election funds. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires.\n\n(iii) Final determination. The Commission will consider any written legal or factual materials submitted by the candidate before making its final determination. A final determination that the candidate is entitled to receive only a portion or no post-election funding will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons for the Commission's action. This statement will explain the legal and factual reasons underlying the Commission's determination and will summarize the results of any investigation on which the determination is based.\n\n(iv) If the candidate demonstrates that the amount of outstanding qualified campaign expenses still exceeds committee assets, the Commission will certify the payment of post-election funds to which the candidate is entitled.\n\n(v) Petitions for rehearing. The candidate may file a petition for rehearing of a final determination under this section in accordance with 11 CFR 9007.5(a).\n\n[56 FR 35919, July 29, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 31877, June 16, 1995; 64 FR 49363, Sept. 13, 1999; 89 FR 220, Jan. 2, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) Winding down costs. Winding down costs are costs associated with the termination of the candidate's general election campaign such as complying with the post-election requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act and the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act, and other necessary administrative costs associated with ending the campaign, including office space rental, staff salaries, and office supplies. Winding down costs are qualified campaign expenses.\n\n(b) Winding down limitation. The total amount of winding down costs that may be paid for with public funds shall not exceed the lesser of:\n\n(1) 2.5% of the expenditure limitation pursuant to 11 CFR 110.8(a)(2); or\n\n(2) 2.5% of the total of:\n\n(i) The candidate's expenditures subject to the expenditure limitation as of the end of the expenditure report period; plus\n\n(ii) The candidate's expenses exempt from the expenditure limitation as of the end of the expenditure report period; except that\n\n(iii) The winding down limitation shall be no less than $100,000.\n\n(c) Allocation of primary and general election winding down costs. A candidate who runs in both the primary and general election may divide winding down expenses between his or her primary and general election committees using any reasonable allocation method. An allocation method is reasonable if it divides the total winding down costs between the primary and general election committees and results in no less than one third of total winding down costs allocated to each committee. A candidate may demonstrate that an allocation method is reasonable even if either the primary or the general election committee is allocated less than one third of total winding down costs.\n\n[68 FR 47416, Aug. 8, 2003]",

(1) After each Presidential election, the Commission will conduct a thorough examination and audit of the receipts, disbursements, debts and obligations of each candidate, his or her authorized committee(s), and agents of such candidates or committees. Such examination and audit will include, but will not be limited to, expenditures pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.4 prior to the beginning of the expenditure report period, contributions to and expenditures made from the legal and accounting compliance fund established under 11 CFR 9003.3(a), contributions received to supplement any payments received from the Fund, and qualified campaign expenses.\n\n(2) In addition, the Commission may conduct other examinations and audits from time to time as it deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this subchapter.\n\n(3) Information obtained pursuant to any audit and examination conducted under 11 CFR 9007.1(a) (1) and (2) may be used by the Commission as the basis, or partial basis, for its repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9007.2.\n\n(b) Conduct of fieldwork. (1) If the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee does not maintain or use any computerized information containing the data listed in 11 CFR 9003.6, the Commission will give the candidate's authorized committee at least two weeks' notice of the Commission's intention to commence fieldwork on the audit and examination. The fieldwork shall be conducted at a site provided by the committee. If the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee maintains or uses computerized information containing any of the data listed in 11 CFR 9003.6, the Commission generally will request such information prior to commencement of audit fieldwork. Such request will be made in writing. The committee shall produce the computerized information no later than 15 calendar days after service of such request. Upon receipt of the computerized information requested and compliance with the technical specifications of 11 CFR 9003.6(b), the Commission will give the candidate's authorized committee at least two weeks' notice of the Commission's intention to commence fieldwork on the audit and examination. The fieldwork shall be conducted at a site provided by the committee. During or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may request additional or updated information which expands the coverage dates of computerized information previously provided, and which may be used for purposes including, but not limited to, updating a statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses. During or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may also request additional computerized information which was created by or becomes available to the committee that is of assistance in the Commission's audit. The committee shall produce the additional or updated computerized information no later than 15 calendar days after service of the Commission's request.\n\n(i) Office space and records. On the date scheduled for the commencement of fieldwork, the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) shall provide Commission staff with office space and committee records in accordance with the candidate and committee agreement under 11 CFR 9003.1(b)(6).\n\n(ii) Availability of committee personnel. On the date scheduled for the commencement of fieldwork, the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) shall have committee personnel present at the site of the fieldwork. Such personnel shall be familiar with the committee's records and operation and shall be available to Commission staff to answer questions and to aid in locating records.\n\n(iii) Failure to provide staff, records or office space. If the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) fail to provide adequate office space, personnel or committee records, the Commission may seek judicial intervention under 52 U.S.C. 30107 or 26 U.S.C. 9010(c) to enforce the candidate and committee agreement made under 11 CFR 9003.1(b). Before seeking judicial intervention, the Commission will notify the candidate of his or her failure to comply with the agreement and will recommend corrective action to bring the candidate into compliance. Upon receipt of the Commission's notification, the candidate will have ten (10) calendar days in which to take the corrective action indicated or to otherwise demonstrate to the Commission in writing that he or she is complying with the candidate and committee agreements.\n\n(iv) If, in the course of the audit process, a dispute arises over the records sought or other requirements of the candidate agreement, the candidate may seek review by the Commission of the issues raised. To seek review, the candidate shall submit a written statement within 10 days after the disputed Commission staff request is made, describing the dispute and indicating the candidate's proposed alternative(s).\n\n(v) If the candidate or his or her authorized committee fails to produce particular records, materials, evidence or other information requested by the Commission, the Commission may issue an order pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30107(a)(1) or a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30107(a)(3). The procedures set forth in 11 CFR 111.11 through 111.15, as appropriate, shall apply to the production of such records, materials, evidence or other information as specified in the order, subpoena or subpoena duces tecum.\n\n(2) Fieldwork will include the following steps designed to keep the candidate and committee informed as to the progress of the audit and to expedite the process:\n\n(i) Entrance conference. At the outset of the fieldwork, Commission staff will hold an entrance conference, at which the candidate's representatives will be advised of the purpose of the audit and the general procedures to be followed. Future requirements of the candidate and his or her authorized committee, such as possible repayments to the United States Treasury, will also be discussed. Committee representatives shall provide information and records necessary to conduct the audit, and Commission staff will be available to answer committee questions.\n\n(ii) Review of records. During the fieldwork, Commission staff will review committee records and may conduct interviews of committee personnel. Commission staff will be available to explain aspects of the audit and examination as it progresses. Additional meetings between Commission staff and committee personnel may be held from time to time during the fieldwork to discuss possible audit findings and to resolve issues arising during the course of the audit.\n\n(iii) Exit conference. At the conclusion of the fieldwork, Commission staff will hold an exit conference to discuss with committee representatives the staff's preliminary findings and recommendations that the staff anticipates it will present to the Commission for approval. Commission staff will advise committee representatives at this conference of the committee's opportunity to respond to these preliminary findings; the projected timetables regarding the issuance of the Preliminary Audit Report, the Audit Report, and any repayment determination; the committee's opportunity for an administrative review of any repayment determination; and the procedures involved in Commission repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9007.2.\n\n(3) Commission staff may conduct additional fieldwork after the completion of the fieldwork conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.1(b) (1) and (2). Factors that may necessitate such follow-up fieldwork include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n(i) Committee response to audit findings;\n\n(ii) Financial activity of the committee subsequent to the fieldwork conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.1(b)(1);\n\n(iii) Committee responses to Commission repayment determinations made under 11 CFR 9007.2.\n\n(4) The Commission will notify the candidate and his or her authorized committee if follow-up fieldwork is necessary. The provisions of 11 CFR 9007.1(b) (1) and (2) will apply to any additional fieldwork conducted.\n\n(c) Preliminary Audit Report: Issuance by Commission and committee response. (1) Commission staff will prepare a written Preliminary Audit Report, which will be provided to the committee after it is approved by an affirmative vote of four (4) members of the Commission. The Preliminary Audit Report may include—\n\n(i) An evaluation of procedures and systems employed by the candidate and committee to comply with applicable provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act, the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act and Commission regulations;\n\n(ii) The accuracy of statements and reports filed with the Commission by the candidate and committee; and\n\n(iii) Preliminary calculations regarding future repayments to the United States Treasury.\n\n(2) The candidate and his or her authorized committee may submit in writing within 60 calendar days after receipt of the Preliminary Audit Report, legal and factual materials disputing or commenting on the proposed findings contained in the Preliminary Audit Report. In addition, the committee shall submit any additional records requested by the Commission. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires.\n\n(d) Approval and issuance of the audit report. (1) Before voting on whether to approve and issue an audit report, the Commission will consider any written legal and factual materials timely submitted by the candidate or his or her authorized committee in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The Commission-approved audit report may address issues other than those contained in the Preliminary Audit Report. In addition, this report will contain a repayment determination made by the Commission pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.2(c)(1).\n\n(2) The audit report may contain issues that warrant referral to the Office of General Counsel for possible enforcement proceedings under 52 U.S.C. 30109 and 11 CFR part 111.\n\n(3) Addenda to the audit report may be approved and issued by the Commission from time to time as circumstances warrant and as additional information becomes available. Such addenda may be based on follow-up fieldwork conducted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and/or information ascertained by the Commission in the normal course of carrying out its supervisory responsibilities. The procedures set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) (1) and (2) of this section will be followed in preparing such addenda. The addenda will be placed on the public record as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. Such addenda may also include additional repayment determination(s).\n\n(e) Public release of audit report. (1) The Commission will consider the audit report in an open session agenda document. The Commission will provide the candidate and the committee with copies of any agenda document to be considered in an open session 24 hours prior to releasing the agenda document to the public.\n\n(2) Following Commission approval of the audit report, the report will be forwarded to the committee and released to the public. The Commission will provide the candidate and committee with copies of the audit report approved by the Commission 24 hours before releasing the report to the public.\n\n(f)(1) Sampling. In conducting an audit of contributions pursuant to this section, the Commission may utilize generally accepted statistical sampling techniques to quantify, in whole or in part, the dollar value of related audit findings. A projection of the total amount of violations based on apparent violations identified in such a sample may become the basis, in whole or in part, of any audit finding.\n\n(2) A committee in responding to a sample-based finding shall respond only to the specific sample items used to make the projection. If the committee demonstrates that any apparent errors found among the sample items were not errors, the Commission shall make a new projection based on the reduced number of errors in the sample.\n\n(3) Within 30 days of service of the Final Audit Report, the committee shall submit a check to the United States Treasury for the total amount of any excessive or prohibited contributions not refunded, reattributed or redesignated in a timely manner in accordance with 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) or (3); or take any other action required by the Commission with respect to sample-based findings.\n\n[56 FR 35924, July 29, 1991; 56 FR 42380, Aug. 27, 1991; 60 FR 31878, June 16, 1995; 64 FR 61780, Nov. 15, 1999; 79 FR 77851, Dec. 29, 2014; 89 FR 220, Jan. 2, 2024]",

(1) A candidate who has received payments from the Fund under 11 CFR part 9005 shall pay the United States Treasury any amounts which the Commission determines to be repayable under this section. In making repayment determinations under this section, the Commission may utilize information obtained from audits and examinations conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.1 or otherwise obtained by the Commission in carrying out its responsibilities under this subchapter.\n\n(2) The Commission will notify the candidate of any repayment determinations made under this section as soon as possible, but not later than 3 years after the day of the presidential election. The Commission's issuance of the audit report to the candidate under 11 CFR 9007.1(d) will constitute notification for purposes of this section.\n\n(3) Once the candidate receives notice of the Commission's repayment determination under this section, the candidate should give preference to the repayment over all other outstanding obligations of his or her committee, except for any federal taxes owed by the committee.\n\n(4) Repayments may be made only from the following sources: personal funds of the candidate (without regard to the limitations of 11 CFR 9003.2(c)), contributions and federal funds in the committee's account(s), and any additional funds raised subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended.\n\n(b) Bases for repayment. The Commission may determine that an eligible candidate of a political party who has received payments from the Fund must repay the United States Treasury under any of the circumstances described below.\n\n(1) Payments in excess of candidate's entitlement. If the Commission determines that any portion of the payments made to the candidate was in excess of the aggregate payments to which such candidate was entitled, it will so notify the candidate, and such candidate shall pay to the United States Treasury an amount equal to such portion.\n\n(2) Use of funds for non-qualified campaign expenses. (i) If the Commission determines that any amount of any payment to an eligible candidate from the Fund was used for purposes other than those described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A) through (C) of this section, it will notify the candidate of the amount so used, and such candidate shall pay to the United States Treasury an amount equal to such amount.\n\n(A) To defray qualified campaign expenses;\n\n(B) To repay loans, the proceeds of which were used to defray qualified campaign expenses; and\n\n(C) To restore funds (other than contributions which were received and expended by minor or new party candidates to defray qualified campaign expenses) which were used to defray qualified campaign expenses.\n\n(ii) Examples of Commission repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9007.2(b)(2) include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n(A) Determinations that a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee(s) or agent(s) have incurred expenses in excess of the aggregate payments to which an eligible major party candidate is entitled;\n\n(B) Determinations that amounts spent by a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee(s) or agent(s) from the Fund were not documented in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.5;\n\n(C) Determinations that any portion of the payments made to a candidate from the Fund was expended in violation of State or Federal law; and\n\n(D) Determinations that any portion of the payments made to a candidate from the Fund was used to defray expenses resulting from a violation of State or Federal law, such as the payment of fines or penalties.\n\n(iii) In the case of a candidate who has received contributions pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.3 (b) or (c), the amount of any repayment sought under this section shall bear the same ratio to the total amount determined to have been used for non-qualified campaign expenses as the amount of payments certified to the candidate from the Fund bears to the total deposits, as of December 31 of the Presidential election year. For purposes of this section, total deposits means all deposits to all candidate accounts minus transfers between accounts, refunds, rebates, reimbursements, checks returned for insufficient funds, proceeds of loans and other similar amounts.\n\n(3) Surplus. If the Commission determines that a portion of payments from the Fund remains unspent after all qualified campaign expenses have been paid, it shall so notify the candidate, and such candidate shall pay the United States Treasury that portion of surplus funds.\n\n(4) Income on investment or other use of payments from the Fund. If the Commission determines that a candidate received any income as a result of an investment or other use of payments from the fund pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.5, it shall so notify the candidate, and such candidate shall pay to the United States Treasury an amount equal to the amount determined to be income, less any Federal, State or local taxes on such income.\n\n(5) Unlawful acceptance of contributions by an eligible candidate of a major party. If the Commission determines that an eligible candidate of a major party, the candidate's authorized committee(s) or agent(s) accepted contributions to defray qualified campaign expenses (other than contributions to make up deficiencies in payments from the Fund, or to defray expenses incurred for legal and accounting services in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.3(a)), it shall notify the candidate of the amount of contributions so accepted, and the candidate shall pay to the United States Treasury an amount equal to such amount.\n\n(c) Repayment determination procedures. The Commission's repayment determination will be made in accordance with the procedures set forth at paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.\n\n(1) Repayment determination. The Commission will provide the candidate with a written notice of its repayment determination(s). This notice will be included in the Commission's audit report prepared pursuant to 11 CFR 9007.1(d) and will set forth the legal and factual reasons for such determination(s), as well as the evidence upon which any such determination is based. The candidate shall repay to the United States Treasury in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the amount which the Commission has determined to be repayable.\n\n(2) Administrative review of repayment determination. If a candidate disputes the Commission's repayment determination(s), he or she may request an administrative review of the determination(s) as set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.\n\n(i) Submission of written materials. A candidate who disputes the Commission's repayment determination(s) shall submit in writing, within 60 calendar days after service of the Commission's notice, legal and factual materials demonstrating that no repayment, or a lesser repayment, is required. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires. The candidate's failure to timely raise an issue in written materials presented pursuant to this paragraph will be deemed a waiver of the candidate's right to raise the issue at any future stage of proceedings including any petition for review filed under 26 U.S.C. 9011(a).\n\n(ii) Oral hearing. A candidate who submits written materials pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section may at the same time request in writing that the Commission provide such candidate with an opportunity to address the Commission in open session to demonstrate that no repayment, or a lesser repayment, is required. The candidate should identify in this request the repayment issues he or she wants to address at the oral hearing. If the Commission decides by an affirmative vote of four (4) of its members to grant the candidate's request, it will inform the candidate of the date and time set for the oral hearing. At the date and time set by the Commission, the candidate or candidate's designated representative will be allotted an amount of time in which to make an oral presentation to the Commission based upon the legal and factual materials submitted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The candidate or representative will also have the opportunity to answer any questions from individual members of the Commission.\n\n(3) Repayment determination upon review. In deciding whether to revise any repayment determination(s) following an administrative review pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Commission will consider any submission made under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section and any oral hearing conducted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, and may also consider any new or additional information from other sources. A determination following an administrative review that a candidate must repay a certain amount will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons supporting the Commission's determination(s). This statement will explain the legal and factual reasons underlying the Commission's determination(s) and will summarize the results of any investigation(s) upon which the determination(s) are based.\n\n(d) Repayment period. (1) Within 90 calendar days of service of the notice of the Commission's repayment determination(s), the candidate shall repay to the United States Treasury the amounts which the Commission has determined to be repayable. Upon application by the candidate, the Commission may grant an extension of up to 90 calendar days in which to make repayment.\n\n(2) If the candidate requests an administrative review of the Commission's repayment determination(s) under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the time for repayment will be suspended until the Commission has concluded its administrative review of the repayment determination(s). Within 30 calendar days after service of the notice of the Commission's post-administrative review repayment determination(s), the candidate shall repay to the United States Treasury the amounts which the Commission has determined to be repayable. Upon application by the candidate, the Commission may grant an extension of up to 90 calendar days in which to make repayment.\n\n(3) Interest shall be assessed on all repayments made after the initial 90-day repayment period established at paragraph (d)(1) of this section or the 30-day repayment period established at paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The amount of interest due shall be the greater of:\n\n(i) An amount calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961 (a) and (b); or\n\n(ii) The amount actually earned on the funds set aside or to be repaid under this section.\n\n(e) Computation of time. The time periods established by this section shall be computed in accordance with 11 CFR 111.2.\n\n(f) Additional repayments. Nothing in this section will prevent the Commission from making additional repayment determinations on one or more of the bases set forth at 11 CFR 9007.2(b) after it has made a repayment determination on any such basis. The Commission may make additional repayment determinations where there exist facts not used as the basis for any previous determination. Any such additional repayment determination will be made in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(g) Newly-discovered assets. If, after any repayment determination made under this section, a candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) receives or becomes aware of assets not previously included in any statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses submitted pursuant to 11 CFR 9004.9, the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) shall promptly notify the Commission of such newly-discovered assets. Newly-discovered assets may include refunds, rebates, late-arriving receivables, and actual receipts for capital assets in excess of the value specified in any previously-submitted statement of net outstanding qualified campaign expenses. Newly-discovered assets may serve as a basis for additional repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9007.2(f).\n\n(h) Limit on repayment. No repayment shall be required from the eligible candidates of a political party under 11 CFR 9007.2 to the extent that such repayment, when added to other repayments required from such candidates under 11 CFR 9007.2, exceeds the amount of payments received by such candidates under 11 CFR 9005.2.\n\n(i) Petitions for rehearing; stays pending appeal. The candidate may file a petition for rehearing of a repayment determination in accordance with 11 CFR 9007.5(a). The candidate may request a stay of a repayment determination in accordance with 11 CFR 9007.5(c) pending the candidate's appeal of that repayment determination.\n\n[56 FR 35924, July 29, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 31878, June 16, 1995]",

(1) Following the Commission's repayment determination or a final determination that a candidate is not entitled to all or a portion of post-election funding under 11 CFR 9004.9(f), the candidate may file a petition for rehearing setting forth the relief desired and the legal and factual basis in support.

The time periods for making repayment under 11 CFR 9007.2(d) shall apply to any amounts determined to be repayable following the Commission's consideration of a petition for rehearing under this section.\n\n(b) Effect of failure to raise issues.

Except as provided by paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the national committee of a major party may not incur convention expenses with respect to a Presidential nominating convention which, in the aggregate, exceed the amount to which such committee is entitled under 11 CFR 9008.4 and 9008.5.\n\n(2) Minor parties. Except as provided by paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the national committee of a minor party may not incur convention expenses with respect to a Presidential nominating convention which, in the aggregate, exceed the amount to which the national committee of a major party is entitled under 11 CFR 9008.4 and 9008.5.\n\n(3) Authorization to exceed limitation. The Commission may authorize the national committee of a major party or minor party to make expenditures for convention expenses, which expenditures exceed the limitation established by paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section. This authorization shall be based upon a determination by the Commission that, due to extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances, the expenditures are necessary to assure the effective operation of the Presidential nominating convention by the committee. Examples of “extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances” include, but are not limited to, a natural disaster or a catastrophic occurrence at the convention site. In no case, however, will such authorization entitle a national committee to receive public funds greater than the entitlement specified under 11 CFR 9008.4 and 9008.5. All private contributions received to defray expenditures under this paragraph shall be subject to all reporting requirements, limitations (except for limitations imposed by paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section) and prohibitions of the Federal Election Campaign Act (52 U.S.C. 30101 et seq.).\n\n(b) Payments not subject to limit—(1) Host committee expenditures. Expenditures made by the host committee shall not be considered expenditures by the national committee and shall not count against the expenditure limitations of this section provided the funds are spent in accordance with 11 CFR 9008.52.\n\n(2) Expenditures by government agencies and municipal funds. Expenditures made by government agencies and municipal funds shall not be considered expenditures by the national committee and shall not count against the expenditure limitations of this section if the funds are spent in accordance with the requirements of 11 CFR 9008.53.\n\n(3) Expenditures to participate in or attend convention. Expenditures made by presidential candidates from campaign accounts, by delegates, or by any other individual from his or her personal funds for the purpose of attending or participating in the convention or convention related activities, including, but not limited to the costs of transportation, lodging and meals, or by State or local committees of a political party on behalf of such delegates or individuals shall not be considered expenditures made by or on behalf of the national party, and shall therefore not be subject to the overall expenditure limitations of this section.\n\n(4) Legal and accounting services. (i) The payment of compensation to an individual by his or her regular employer for legal and accounting services rendered to or on behalf of the national committee shall not be considered an expenditure and shall not count against the expenditure limitations of this section.\n\n(ii) The payment by the national committee of compensation to any individual for legal and accounting services rendered to or on behalf of the national committee in connection with the presidential nominating convention or convention-related activities shall not be considered an expenditure and shall not count against the expenditure limitations of this section provided that:\n\n(A) The legal and accounting services relate solely to compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act (52 U.S.C. 30101, et seq.) and the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act (26 U.S.C. Chapter 95); and\n\n(B) The contributions raised to pay for the legal and accounting services comply with the limitations and prohibitions of 11 CFR parts 110, 114 and 115. These contributions, when aggregated with other contributions from the same contributor to the political committees established and maintained by the national political party, shall not exceed the amounts permitted under 11 CFR 110.1(c) and 110.2(c), as applicable.\n\n(iii) The convention committee shall report contributions received to pay for legal and accounting services on a separate Schedule A, and shall report payments for legal and accounting services on a separate Schedule B, attached to its reports.\n\n(5) Computerized information. Payments to defray the costs of producing, delivering and explaining the computerized information and materials provided pursuant to 11 CFR 9008.10(h), and explaining the operation of the computer system's software, shall not be considered expenditures and shall not count against the expenditure limitations of this section, provided that the contributions raised to pay these expenses comply with the limitations and prohibitions of 11 CFR parts 110, 114 and 115.\n\n[59 FR 33616, June 29, 1994, as amended at 68 FR 47416, Aug. 8, 2003; 79 FR 77851, Dec. 29, 2014]",

For purposes of this section, the term capital asset means any property used in the operation of the convention whose purchase price exceeded $2000 when acquired by the committee. Property that must be valued as capital assets under this section includes, but is not limited to, office equipment, furniture, vehicles and fixtures acquired for use in the operation of the convention, but does not include property defined as “other assets” under 11 CFR 9008.10(g)(5). A list of all capital assets shall be maintained by the committee, which shall include a brief description of each capital asset, the purchase price, the date it was acquired, the method of disposition and the amount received in disposition. The fair market value of capital assets may be considered to be the total original cost of such items when acquired less 40%, to account for depreciation. If the committee wishes to claim a higher depreciation percentage for an item, it must list that capital asset on the statement separately and demonstrate, through documentation, the fair market value of each such asset.\n\n(5) Other assets.

A list of other assets shall be maintained by the committee, which shall include a brief description of each such asset, the fair market value of each asset, the method of disposition and the amount received in disposition.\n\n(6) Collectibility of accounts receivable.

If the convention committee maintains or uses computerized information containing any of the categories of data listed in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(iv) of this section, the committee shall provide computerized magnetic media, such as magnetic tapes or magnetic diskettes, containing the computerized information at the times specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section:\n\n(i) Information required by law to be maintained regarding the committee's receipts or disbursements;\n\n(ii) Records used to reconcile bank statements;\n\n(iii) Records relating to the acquisition, use and disposition of capital assets; and\n\n(iv) Any other information that may be used during the Commission's audit to review the committee's receipts, disbursements, loans, debts, obligations, or bank reconciliations.\n\n(2) Time for Production. If the committee maintains or uses computerized information containing any of the data listed in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the Commission generally will request such information prior to commencement of audit fieldwork. Such request will be made in writing. The committee shall produce the computerized information no later than 15 calendar days after service of such request. During or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may request additional or updated computerized information which expands the coverage dates of computerized information previously provided. During or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may also request additional computerized information which was created by or becomes available to the committee that is of assistance in the Commission's audit. The committee shall produce the additional or updated computerized information no later than 15 calendar days after service of the Commission's request.\n\n(3) Organization of computerized information and technical specifications. The computerized magnetic media shall be prepared and delivered at the committee's expense and shall conform to the technical specifications, including file requirements, described in the Federal Election Commission's Computerized Magnetic Media Requirements for Title 26 Candidates/Committees Receiving Federal Funding. The data contained in the computerized magnetic media provided to the Commission shall be organized in the order specified by the Computerized Magnetic Media Requirements.\n\n(4) Additional materials and assistance. Upon request, the committee shall produce documentation explaining the computer system's software capabilities, such as user guides, technical manuals, formats, layouts and other materials for processing and analyzing the information request. Upon request, the committee shall also make available such personnel as are necessary to explain the operation of the computer system's software and the computerized information prepared or maintained by the committee.\n\n[59 FR 33616, June 29, 1994, as amended at 68 FR 47416, Aug. 8, 2003]",

If the Commission determines that any portion of the payments to the national committee or convention committee under 11 CFR 9008.6(b) was in excess of the aggregate payments to which the national committee was entitled under 11 CFR 9008.4 and 9008.5, it shall so notify the national committee, and the national committee shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to such portion.\n\n(2) Excessive expenditures. If the Commission determines that the national committee or convention committee incurred convention expenses in excess of the limitations under 11 CFR 9008.8(a), it shall notify the national committee of the amount of such excessive expenditures, and the national committee shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount specified.\n\n(3) Excessive contributions. If the Commission determines that the national committee accepted contributions to defray convention expenses which, when added to the amount of payments received, exceeds the expenditure limitation of such party, it shall notify the national committee of the amount of the contributions so accepted, and the national committee shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount specified.\n\n(4) Improper usage or documentation. If the Commission determines that any amount of any payment to the national committee or convention committee under 11 CFR 9008.6(b) was used for any purposes other than the purposes authorized at 11 CFR 9008.7 or was not documented in accordance with 11 CFR 9008.10, it shall notify the national committee of the amount improperly used or documented and the national committee shall pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the amount specified.\n\n(5) Unspent funds. (i) If any portion of the payment under 11 CFR 9008.4 remains unspent after all convention expenses have been paid, that portion shall be returned to the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n(ii) The national committee or convention committee shall make an interim repayment of unspent funds based on the financial position of the committee as of the end of the ninth month following the last day of the convention, allowing for a reasonable amount as determined by the Commission to be withheld for unanticipated contingencies. The interim repayment shall be made no later than 30 calendar days after the end of the ninth month following the last day of the convention. If, after written request by the national committee or convention committee, the Commission determines, upon review of evidence presented by either committee, that amounts previously refunded are needed to defray convention expenses, the Commission shall certify such amount for payment.\n\n(iii) All unspent funds shall be repaid to the U.S. Treasury no later than 24 months after the last day of the convention, unless the national committee has been granted an extension of time. The Commission may grant any extension of time it deems appropriate upon request of the national committee.\n\n(6) Income on investments of payments from the Fund. If the Commission determines that the national committee or the convention committee received any income as a result of investment or other use of payments from the Fund pursuant to 11 CFR 9008.7(a)(5), it shall so notify the committee and the committee shall pay to the United States Treasury an amount equal to the amount determined to be income, less any Federal, State or local taxes on such income.\n\n(7) The Commission may seek repayment, or may initiate an enforcement action, if the convention committee knowingly helps, assists or participates in the making of a convention expenditure by the host committee, government agency or municipal fund that is not in accordance with 11 CFR 9008.52 or 9008.53, or the acceptance of a contribution by the host committee or government agency or municipal fund from an impermissible source.\n\n(c) Repayment determination procedures. The Commission will follow the same repayment determination procedures, and the committee has the same rights and obligations as are provided for repayment determinations involving publicly funded candidates under 11 CFR 9007.2 (c) through (h).\n\n[59 FR 33616, June 29, 1994, as amended at 60 FR 31880, June 16, 1995; 68 FR 47417, Aug. 8, 2003]",

A candidate determined to be ineligible under 11 CFR 9033.5(b) by failing to obtain the required percentage of votes in two consecutive primaries may have his or her eligibility reestablished if the candidate receives at least 20 percent of the total number of votes cast for candidates of the same party for the same office in a primary election held subsequent to the date of the election which rendered the candidate ineligible.\n\n(c) The Commission will make its determination under 11 CFR 9033.8 (a) or (b) without requiring the individual to reestablish eligibility under 11 CFR 9033.1 and 2. A candidate whose eligibility is reestablished under this section may submit, for matching payment, contributions received during ineligibility. Any expenses incurred during the period of ineligibility that would have been considered qualified campaign expenses if the candidate had been eligible during that time may be defrayed with matching payments.",

Payments from the matching payment account that are received after the candidate's date of ineligibility may be used to defray the candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations, but shall not be used to defray any costs associated with continuing to campaign unless the candidate reestablishes eligibility under 11 CFR 9033.8.\n\n(4) Taxes. Federal income taxes paid by the committee on non-exempt function income, such as interest, dividends and sale of property, shall be considered qualified campaign expenses.

The following are examples of disbursements that are not qualified campaign expenses.\n\n(2) Excessive expenditures. An expenditure which is in excess of any of the limitations under 11 CFR part 9035 shall not be considered a qualified campaign expense.

In addition, any expenses incurred before the candidate's date of ineligibility for goods and services to be received after the candidate's date of ineligibility, or for property, services, or facilities used to benefit the candidate's general election campaign, are not qualified campaign expenses.\n\n(4) Civil or criminal penalties. Civil or criminal penalties paid pursuant to the Federal Election Campaign Act are not qualified campaign expenses and cannot be defrayed from contributions or matching payments. Any amounts received or expended to pay such penalties shall not be considered contributions or expenditures but all amounts so received shall be subject to the prohibitions of the Act. Amounts received and expended under this section shall be reported in accordance with 11 CFR part 104.\n\n(5) Payments to candidate. Payments made to the candidate by his or her committee, other than to reimburse funds advanced by the candidate for qualified campaign expenses, are not qualified campaign expenses.\n\n(6) Payments to other authorized committees. Payments, including transfers and loans, to other committees authorized by the same candidate for a different election are not qualified campaign expenses.\n\n(7) Allocable expenses. Payments for expenses subject to state allocation under 11 CFR 106.2 are not qualified campaign expenses if the records retained are not sufficient to permit allocation to any state, such as the failure to keep records of the date on which the expense is incurred.\n\n(8) Lost, misplaced, or stolen items. The cost of lost, misplaced, or stolen items may be considered a nonqualified campaign expense. Factors considered by the Commission in making this determination shall include, but not be limited to, whether the committee demonstrates that it made conscientious efforts to safeguard the missing equipment; whether the committee sought or obtained insurance on the items; whether the committee filed a police report; the type of equipment involved; and the number and value of items that were lost.\n\n(c) [Reserved]\n\n(d) Transfers to other campaigns—(1) Other Federal offices. If a candidate has received matching funds and is simultaneously seeking nomination or election to another Federal office, no transfer of funds between his or her principal campaign committees or authorized committees may be made. See 52 U.S.C. 30116(a)(5)(C) and 11 CFR 110.3(c)(5) and 110.8(d). A candidate will be considered to be simultaneously seeking nomination or election to another Federal office if he or she is seeking nomination or election to such Federal office under 11 CFR 110.3(c)(5).\n\n(2) General election. If a candidate has received matching funds, all transfers from the candidate's primary election account to a legal and accounting compliance fund established for the general election must be made in accordance with 11 CFR 9003.3(a)(1).\n\n(e) Attribution of expenditures between the primary and the general election spending limits. The following rules apply to candidates who receive public funding in either the primary or the general election, or both.\n\n(1) General rule. Any expenditure for goods or services that are used for the primary election campaign, other than those listed in paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(7) of this section, shall be attributed to the limits set forth at 11 CFR 9035.1. Any expenditure for goods or services that are used for the general election campaign, other than those listed in paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(7) of this section, shall be attributed to the limits set forth at 11 CFR 110.8(a)(2), as adjusted under 11 CFR 110.17(a).\n\n(2) Polling expenses. Polling expenses shall be attributed according to when the results of the poll are received. If the results are received on or before the date of the candidate's nomination, the expenses shall be considered primary election expenses. If results are received from a single poll both before and after the date of the candidate's nomination, the costs shall be allocated between the primary and the general election limits based on the percentage of results received during each period.\n\n(3) State or national campaign offices. Prior to the date of the last primary election in a Presidential election year, overhead and salary costs incurred in connection with state or national campaign offices shall be attributed to the primary election. With regard to overhead and salary costs incurred on or after June 1 of the Presidential election year, but before or on the date of nomination, the committee may attribute to the general election an amount not to exceed 15% of the limitation on primary-election expenditures set forth at 11 CFR 110.8(a)(1). Overhead and payroll costs associated with winding down the campaign and compliance activities shall be governed by paragraph (a)(3) of this section.\n\n(4) Campaign materials. Expenditures for campaign materials, including bumper stickers, campaign brochures, buttons, pens and similar items, that are purchased by the primary election campaign committee and later transferred to and used by the general election committee shall be attributed to the general election limits. Materials transferred to but not used by the general election committee shall be attributed to the primary election limits.\n\n(5) Media production costs. For media communications that are broadcast or published both before and after the date of the candidate's nomination, 50% of the media production costs shall be attributed to the primary election limits, and 50% to the general election limits. Distribution costs, including such costs as air time and advertising space in newspapers, shall be paid for 100% by the primary or general election campaign depending on when the communication is broadcast or distributed.\n\n(6) Campaign communications. (i) Solicitations and fundraising costs. The costs of fundraising, including that of events and solicitation costs, shall be attributed to the primary election or to the GELAC, depending on the purposes of the fundraising. If a candidate raises funds for both the primary election and for the GELAC in a single communication or through a single fundraising event, the allocation of fundraising costs and the distribution of net proceeds will be made in the same manner as described in 11 CFR 9034.8(c)(8)(i) and (ii).\n\n(ii) Other communications. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the costs of a campaign communication that does not include a solicitation shall be attributed to the primary or general election limits based on the date on which the communication is broadcast, published or mailed. The cost of a communication that is broadcast, published or mailed before the date of the candidate's nomination shall be attributed to the primary election limits.\n\n(7) Travel costs. Expenditures for campaign-related transportation, food, and lodging by any individual, including a candidate, shall be attributed according to when the travel occurs. If the travel occurs on or before the date of the candidate's nomination, the cost is a primary election expense. Travel to and from the convention shall be attributed to the primary election. Travel by a person who is working exclusively on general election campaign preparations shall be considered a general election expense even if the travel occurs before the candidate's nomination.\n\n[56 FR 35934, July 29, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 31881, June 16, 1995; 60 FR 57537, 57538, Nov. 16, 1995; 64 FR 49364, Sept. 13, 1999; 64 FR 61781, Nov. 15, 1999; 67 FR 78683, Dec. 26, 2002; 68 FR 47418, Aug. 8, 2003; 79 FR 77851, Dec. 29, 2014]",

    "content": "(a) Within 15 calendar days after the candidate's date of ineligibility, as determined under 11 CFR 9033.5, the candidate shall submit a statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. The candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations under this section equal the difference between paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section:\n\n(1) The total of all outstanding obligations for qualified campaign expenses as of the candidate's date of ineligibility as determined under 11 CFR 9033.5, plus estimated necessary winding down costs as defined under 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(3), less\n\n(2) The total of:\n\n(i) Cash on hand as of the close of business on the last day of eligibility (including all contributions dated on or before that date whether or not submitted for matching; currency; balances on deposit in banks; savings and loan institutions; and other depository institutions; traveler's checks; certificates of deposit; treasury bills; and any other committee investments valued at fair market value);\n\n(ii) The fair market value of capital assets and other assets on hand; and\n\n(iii) Amounts owed to the committee in the form of credits, refunds of deposits, returns, receivables, or rebates of qualified campaign expenses; or a commercially reasonable amount based on the collectibility of those credits, returns, receivables or rebates.\n\n(b) Liabilities. (1) The amount submitted as the total of outstanding campaign obligations under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not include any accounts payable for non-qualified campaign expenses nor any amounts determined or anticipated to be required as repayment under 11 CFR part 9038 or any amounts paid to secure a surety bond under 11 CFR 9038.5.\n\n(2) The amount submitted as estimated necessary winding down costs under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be broken down by expense category and quarterly or monthly time period. This breakdown shall include estimated costs for office space rental, staff salaries, legal expenses, accounting expenses, office supplies, equipment rental, telephone expenses, postage and other mailing costs, printing and storage. The breakdown shall estimate the costs that will be incurred in each category from the time the statement is submitted until the expected termination of the committee's political activity.\n\n(c)(1) Capital assets. For purposes of this section, the term capital assets means any property used in the operation of the campaign whose purchase price exceeded $2000 when received by the committee. Property that must be valued as capital assets under this section includes, but is not limited to, office equipment, furniture, vehicles and fixtures acquired for use in the operation of the candidate's campaign, but does not include property defined as “other assets” under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Capital assets include items such as computer systems and telecommunications systems, if the equipment is used together and if the total cost of all components that are used together exceeds $2000. A list of all capital assets shall be maintained by the committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.11(d). The fair market value of capital assets shall be considered to be 60% of the total original cost of such items when acquired, except that items received after the date of ineligibility must be valued at their fair market value on the date received. A candidate may claim a lower fair market value for a capital asset by listing that capital asset on the statement separately and demonstrating, through records, the lower fair market value. If the candidate receives public funding for the general election, a lower fair market value shall not be claimed under this section for any capital assets transferred or sold to the candidate's general election committee.\n\n(2) Other assets. The term other assets means any property acquired by the committee for use in raising funds or as collateral for campaign loans. “Other assets” must be included on the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations if the aggregate value of such assets exceeds $5000. The value of “other assets” shall be determined by the fair market value of each item on the candidate's date of ineligibility or on the date the item is acquired if acquired after the date of ineligibility. A list of other assets shall be maintained by the committee in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.11(d)(2).\n\n(d) Collectibility of accounts receivable. If the committee determines that an account receivable of $500 or more, including any credit, refund, return or rebate, is not collectible in whole or in part, the committee shall demonstrate through records that the determination was commercially reasonable. The records shall include records showing the original amount of the account receivable, copies of correspondence and memoranda of communications with the debtor showing attempts to collect the amount due, and an explanation of how the lesser amount or full writeoff was determined.\n\n(e) Contributions received from joint fundraising activities conducted under 11 CFR 9034.8 may be used to pay a candidate's outstanding campaign obligations.\n\n(1) Such contributions shall be deemed monies available to pay outstanding campaign obligations as of the date these funds are received by the fundraising representative committee and shall be included in the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations.\n\n(2) The amount of money deemed available to pay a candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations will equal either—\n\n(i) An amount calculated on the basis of the predetermined allocation formula, as adjusted for 52 U.S.C. 30116 limitations; or\n\n(ii) If a candidate receives an amount greater than that calculated under 11 CFR 9034.5(e)(2)(i), the amount actually received.\n\n(f)(1) With each submission for matching fund payments filed after the candidate's date of ineligibility, the candidate shall certify that, as of the close of business on the last business day preceding the date of submission for matching funds, his or her remaining net outstanding campaign obligations equal or exceed the amount submitted for matching.\n\n(2) A candidate who makes a submission for matching fund payments after his or her date of ineligibility shall also submit a revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. This revised statement shall be due before the next regularly scheduled payment date, on a date to be determined and published by the Commission. This statement shall reflect the financial status of the campaign as of the close of business three business days before the due date of the statement. The revised statement shall also contain a brief explanation of each change in the committee's assets and obligations from the previous statement.\n\n(3) After a candidate's date of ineligibility, if the candidate does not receive the entire amount of matching funds on a regularly scheduled payment date due to a shortfall in the matching payment account, the candidate shall also submit a revised statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. The revised statement shall be filed on a date to be determined and published by the commission, which will be before the next regularly scheduled payment date.\n\n(g)(1) If the Commission receives information indicating that substantial assets of the candidate's authorized committee(s) have been undervalued or not included in the statement or that the amount of outstanding campaign obligations has been otherwise overstated in relation to committee assets, the Commission may decide to temporarily suspend further matching payments pending a final determination whether the candidate is entitled to receive all or a portion of the matching funds requested.\n\n(2) In making a determination under 11 CFR 9034.5(g)(1), the Commission will follow the procedures for initial and final determinations under 11 CFR 9033.10 (b) and (c). The Commission will notify the candidate of its initial determination within 15 business days after receipt of the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. Within 15 business days after service of the Commission's notice, the candidate may submit written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that he or she has net outstanding campaign obligations that entitle the campaign to further matching payments.\n\n(3) If the candidate demonstrates that the amount of outstanding campaign obligations still exceeds committee assets, he or she may continue to receive matching payments.\n\n(4) Following a final determination under this section, the candidate may file a petition for rehearing in accordance with 11 CFR 9038.5(a).\n\n[56 FR 34132, July 25, 1991 and 56 FR 35934, July 29, 1991; 56 FR 42380, Aug. 27, 1991; 60 FR 31883, June 16, 1995; 64 FR 49364, Sept. 13, 1999; 79 FR 77851, Dec. 29, 2014; 89 FR 220, Jan. 2, 2024]",

Any reimbursement received in excess of this amount shall be disposed of in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this section, a media representative's pro rata share shall be calculated by dividing the total actual cost of the transportation and services provided by the total number of individuals to whom such transportation and services are made available. For purposes of this calculation, the total number of individuals shall include committee staff, media personnel, Secret Service personnel, national security staff and any other individuals to whom such transportation and services are made available, except that, when seeking reimbursement for transportation costs paid by the committee under 11 CFR 100.93 and 9034.7(b)(5)(i), the total number of individuals shall not include national security staff.\n\n(3) No later than sixty (60) days of the campaign trip or event, the committee shall provide each media representative attending the event with an itemized bill that specifies the amounts charged for air and ground transportation for each segment of the trip, housing, meals, telephone and internet service, and other billable items specified in the White House Press Corps Travel Policies and Procedures issued by the White House Travel Office. Payments shall be due sixty (60) days from the date of the bill, unless the media representative disputes the charges.\n\n(c) Deduction of reimbursements from expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation. (1) The Committee may deduct from the amount of expenditures subject to the overall expenditure limitation:\n\n(i) The amount of reimbursements received from media representatives in payment for the transportation and services described in paragraph (a) of this section, up to the actual cost of the transportation and services provided to media representatives; and\n\n(ii) An additional amount of the reimbursements received from media representatives, representing the administrative costs incurred by the committee in providing these services to the media representatives and seeking reimbursement for them, equal to:\n\n(A) Three percent of the actual cost of transportation and services provided to the media representatives under this section; or\n\n(B) An amount in excess of 3% representing the administrative costs actually incurred by the committee in providing services to the media representatives, provided that the committee is able to document the total amount of administrative costs actually incurred.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this paragraph, “administrative costs” includes all costs incurred by the committee in making travel arrangements and seeking reimbursement, whether these services are performed by committee staff or by independent contractors.\n\n(d) Disposal of excess reimbursements. If the committee receives reimbursements in excess of the amount deductible under paragraph (c) of this section, it shall dispose of the excess amount in the following manner:\n\n(1) Any reimbursement received in excess of 110% of the actual pro rata cost of the transportation and services made available to a media representative shall be returned to the media representative.\n\n(2) Any amount in excess of the amount deductible under paragraph (c) of this section that is not required to be returned to the media representative under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be paid to the Treasury.\n\n(e) Reporting. The total amount paid by an authorized committee for the services and facilities described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, plus the administrative costs incurred by the committee in providing these services and facilities and seeking reimbursement for them, shall be reported as an expenditure in accordance with 11 CFR 104.3(b)(2)(i).

Such portion shall be determined by calculating what the trip would have cost from the point of origin of the trip to the first campaign-related stop and from that stop through each subsequent campaign-related stop, back to the point of origin. If any campaign activity, other than incidental contacts, is conducted at a stop, that stop shall be considered campaign-related. Campaign activity includes soliciting, making, or accepting contributions, and expressly advocating the election or defeat of the candidate. Other factors, including the setting, timing and statements or expressions of the purpose of an event and the substance of the remarks or speech made, will also be considered in determining whether a stop is campaign-related.\n\n(3) For each trip, an itinerary shall be prepared and such itinerary shall be made available by the committee for Commission inspection. The itinerary shall show the time of arrival and departure and the type of event held.\n\n(4) For trips by government conveyance or by charter, a list of all passengers on such trip, along with a designation of which passengers are and which are not campaign-related, shall be made available for Commission inspection.

If the spouse or family members conduct campaign-related activities, their travel expenses will be treated as qualified campaign expenses and reportable expenditures.\n\n(7) If any individual, including a candidate, incurs expenses for campaign-related travel, other than by use of government conveyance or accommodations, an amount equal to that portion of the actual cost of the conveyance or accommodations which is allocable to all passengers, including the candidate, who are traveling for campaign purposes will be a qualified campaign expense and shall be reported by the committee as an expenditure.\n\n(i) If the trip is by charter, the actual cost for each passenger shall be determined by dividing the total operating cost for the charter by the total number of passengers transported. The amount which is a qualified campaign expense and a reportable expenditure shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9034.7(b)(2) on the basis of the actual cost per passenger multiplied by the number of passengers traveling for campaign purposes.\n\n(ii) If the trips is by non-charter commercial transportation, the actual cost shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set forth at 11 CFR 9034.7(b)(2) on the basis of the commercial fare.

The fundraising representative shall retain the written agreement for a period of three years and shall make it available to the Commission on request.\n\n(2) Funds advanced for fundraising costs. (i) Except as provided in 11 CFR 9034.8(c)(2)(ii), the amount of funds advanced by each participant for fundraising costs shall be in proportion to the allocation formula agreed upon under 11 CFR 9034.8(c)(1).\n\n(ii) A participant may advance more than its proportionate share of the fundraising costs; however, the amount advanced which is in excess of the participant's proportionate share shall not exceed the amount that participant could legally contribute to the remaining participants.

(i) The participants or the fundraising representative shall establish a separate depository account to be used solely for the receipt and disbursement of the joint fundraising proceeds. All contributions deposited into the separate depository account must be permissible under Title 52, United States Code. Each political committee shall amend its Statement of Organization to reflect the account as an additional depository.\n\n(ii) The fundraising representative shall deposit all joint fundraising proceeds in the separate depository account within ten days of receipt as required by 11 CFR 103.3. The fundraising representative may delay distribution of the fundraising proceeds to the participants until all contributions are received and all expenses are paid.\n\n(iii) For contribution reporting and limitation purposes, the date of receipt of a contribution by a participating political committee is the date that the contribution is received by the fundraising representative. The fundraising representative shall report contributions in the reporting period in which they are received. Participating political committees shall report joint fundraising proceeds in accordance with 11 CFR 9034.8(c)(9) when such funds are received from the fundraising representative.\n\n(5) Recordkeeping requirements. (i) The fundraising representative and participating committees shall screen all contributions received to insure that the prohibitions and limitations of 11 CFR parts 110 and 114 are observed. Participating political committees shall make their contributor records available to the fundraising representative to enable the fundraising representative to carry out its duty to screen contributions.\n\n(ii) The fundraising representative shall collect and retain contributor information with regard to gross proceeds as required under 11 CFR 102.8 and shall also forward such information to participating political committees.\n\n(iii) The fundraising representative shall retain the records required under 11 CFR 9033.11 regarding fundraising disbursements for a period of three years. Commercial fundraising firms or agents shall forward such information to the fundraising representative.\n\n(6) Contribution limitations. Except to the extent that the contributor has previously contributed to any of the participants, a contributor may make a contribution to the joint fundraising effort which contribution represents the total amount that the contributor could contribute to all of the participants under the applicable limits of 11 CFR 110.1 and 110.2.\n\n(7) Allocation of gross proceeds. (i) The fundraising representative shall allocate proceeds according to the formula stated in the fundraising agreement. Each contribution received shall be allocated among the participants in accordance with the allocation formula, unless the circumstances described in paragraphs (c)(7) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section apply. Funds may not be distributed or reallocated so as to maximize the matchability of the contributions.\n\n(ii) If distribution according to the allocation formula extinguishes the debts of one or more participants or if distribution under the formula results in a violation of the contribution limits of 11 CFR 110.1(b), the fundraising representative may reallocate the surplus funds. The fundraising representative shall not reallocate funds so as to allow candidates seeking to extinguish outstanding debts to rely on the receipt of matching funds to pay the remainder of their debts; rather, all funds to which a participant is entitled under the allocation formula shall be deemed funds available to pay the candidate's outstanding campaign obligations as provided in 11 CFR 9034.5(c).\n\n(iii) Reallocation shall be based upon the remaining participant's proportionate shares under the allocation formula. If reallocation results in a violation of a contributor's limit under 11 CFR 110.1, the fundraising representative shall return to the contributor the amount of the contribution that exceeds the limit.\n\n(iv) Earmarked contributions which exceed the contributor's limit to the designated participant under 11 CFR part 110 may not be reallocated by the fundraising representative without the prior written permission of the contributor. A written instrument made payable to one of the participants shall be considered an earmarked contribution unless a written statement by the contributor indicates that it is intended for inclusion in the general proceeds of the fundraising activity.\n\n(8) Allocation of expenses and distribution of net proceeds. (i) If participating committees are not affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity and are not committees of the same political party:\n\n(A) After gross contributions are allocated among the participants under 11 CFR 9034.8(c)(7), the fundraising representative shall calculate each participant's share of expenses based on the percentage of the total receipts each participant had been allocated. To calculate each participant's net proceeds, the fundraising representative shall subtract the participant's share of expenses from the amount that participant has been allocated from gross proceeds.\n\n(B) A participant may only pay expenses on behalf of another participant subject to the contribution limits of 11 CFR part 110. See also 11 CFR 9034.4(b)(6).\n\n(C) The expenses from a series of fundraising events or activities shall be allocated among the participants on a per-event basis regardless of whether the participants change or remain the same throughout the series.\n\n(ii) If participating committees are affiliated as defined in 11 CFR 110.3 prior to the joint fundraising activity or if participants are party committees of the same political party, expenses need not be allocated among those participants. Payment of such expenses by an unregistered committee or organization on behalf of an affiliated political committee may cause the unregistered organization to become a political committee.\n\n(iii) Payment of expenses may be made from gross proceeds by the fundraising representative.\n\n(9) Reporting of receipts and disbursements—(i) Reporting receipts. (A) The fundraising representative shall report all funds received in the reporting period in which they are received. Each Schedule A filed by the fundraising representative under this section shall clearly indicate that the contributions reported on that schedule represent joint fundraising proceeds.\n\n(B) After distribution of net proceeds, each participating political committee shall report its share of net proceeds received as a transfer-in from the fundraising representative. Each participating political committee shall also file a memo Schedule A itemizing its share of gross receipts as contributions from original contributors to the extent required under 11 CFR 104.3(a).\n\n(ii) Reporting disbursements. The fundraising representative shall report all disbursements in the reporting period in which they are made. Each participant shall report in a memo Schedule B his or her total allocated share of these disbursements in the same reporting period in which net proceeds are distributed and reported and include the amount on page 4 of Form 3-P, under “Expenditures Subject to Limit.”\n\n[56 FR 35934, July 29, 1991; 56 FR 42380, Aug. 27, 1991, as amended at 67 FR 49132, July 29, 2002; 79 FR 77851, Dec. 29, 2014; 89 FR 221, Jan. 2, 2024]",

A primary election candidate who runs in the general election, regardless of whether the candidate receives public funds for the general election, must wait until 31 days after the general election before using any matching funds for winding down costs related to the primary election. No expenses incurred by a primary election candidate who runs in the general election prior to 31 days after the general election shall be considered primary winding down costs.\n\n[68 FR 47419, Aug. 8, 2003]",

(1) A candidate may exclude from the overall expenditure limitation set forth in paragraph (a) of this section an amount equal to 15% of the overall expenditure limitation as exempt legal and accounting compliance costs under 11 CFR 100.146. In the case of a candidate who does not run in the general election, for purposes of the expenditure limitations set forth in this section, 100% of salary, overhead and computer expenses incurred after a candidate's date of ineligibility may be treated as exempt legal and accounting compliance expenses beginning with the first full reporting period after the candidate's date of ineligibility. Candidates who continue to campaign or re-establish eligibility may not treat 100% of salary, overhead and computer expenses incurred during the period between the date of ineligibility and the date on which the candidate either re-establishes eligibility or ceases to continue to campaign as exempt legal and accounting compliance expenses. For purposes of the expenditure limitations set forth in this section, candidates who run in the general election, regardless of whether they receive public funds, must wait until 31 days after the general election before they may treat 100% of salary, overhead and computer expenses as exempt legal and accounting compliance expenses.\n\n(2) A candidate may exclude from the overall expenditure limitation of 11 CFR 9035.1 the amount of exempt fundraising costs specified in 11 CFR 100.152(c).\n\n(3) If any matching funds to which the candidate is entitled are not paid to the candidate, or are paid after the date on which payment is due, the candidate may exclude from the overall expenditure limitation in paragraph (a) of this section the amount of all interest charges that accrued during the shortfall period on all loans obtained by the candidate or authorized committee that are guaranteed or secured with matching funds, provided the candidate submits records as to the amount of all interest charges on such loans. The shortfall period begins on the first regularly scheduled payment date on which the candidate does not receive the entire amount of matching funds and ends on the payment date when the candidate receives the previously certified matching funds or the date on which the Commission revises the amount previously certified to eliminate the entitlement to the previously certified matching funds.\n\n(d) Candidates not receiving matching funds.

In lieu of submitting photocopies, the candidate may submit digital images of checks, written instruments and deposit slips . The candidate may also submit digital images of contributor redesignations, reattributions and supporting statements and materials needed to verify the matchability of contributions.

Additional information on the records required to accompany such contributions is found in the Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order. See 11 CFR 9033.1(b)(9).\n\n(2) Following the first submission under 11 CFR 9036.2(b)(1), candidates may request additional matching funds on dates prescribed by the Commission by making a full submission as required under 11 CFR 9036.2(b)(1). The amount requested for matching may include contributions received up to the last business day preceding the date of the request.\n\n(c) Additional submissions submitted in non-Presidential election year. The candidate may submit additional contributions for review during the year preceding the presidential election year; however, the amount of each submission made during this period must exceed $50,000. Additional submissions filed by a candidate in a non-Presidential election year will not result in payment of matching funds to the candidate until after January 1 of the Presidential election year.

See 11 CFR 9036.4 for Commission procedures for certification of additional payments.\n\n(2) After a candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will review each additional submission and resubmission, and will certify to the Secretary, at least once a month on dates to be determined and published by the Commission, an amount to which the ineligible candidate is entitled in accordance with 11 CFR 9034.1(b), unless the projected dollar value of the nonmatchable contributions contained in the submission or resubmission exceeds 15% of the amount requested. In the latter case, the Commission will return the additional submission or resubmission to the candidate and request that it be corrected, unless the resubmission was made on the last date for resubmissions in September of the year following the Presidential election year. Corrected submissions and resubmissions will be reviewed by the Commission in accordance with 11 CFR 9036.4 and 9036.5. Submissions and resubmissions will not be considered to be corrected unless the projected dollar value of nonmatchable contributions has been reduced to no more than 15% of the amount requested.\n\n[56 FR 34132, July 25, 1991; 56 FR 41891, Aug. 23, 1991; 60 FR 31885, June 16, 1995; 64 FR 42585, Aug. 5, 1999; 64 FR 49365, Sept. 13, 1999; 68 FR 47420, Aug. 8, 2003; 79 FR 77852, Dec. 29, 2014; 89 FR 221, Jan. 2, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) Non-acceptance of submission for review of matchability. (1) The Commission will make an initial review of each submission made under 11 CFR part 9036 to determine if it substantially meets the format requirements of 11 CFR 9036.1(b) and 9036.2(b) and the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order. If the Commission determines that a submission does not substantially meet these requirements, it will not review the matchability of the contributions contained therein.\n\n(2) For submissions made in the year before the Presidential election year (other than submissions made on the last submission date in that year), and submissions made after the candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will stop reviewing the submission once the projected dollar value of nonmatchable contributions exceeds 15% of the amount requested, as provided in 11 CFR 9036.2 (c) or (d), as applicable.\n\n(3) Under either paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the Commission will return the submission to the candidate and request that it be corrected in accordance with the applicable requirements. If the candidate makes a corrected submission within 5 business days after the Commission's return of the original, the Commission will review the corrected submission prior to the next regularly scheduled submission date, and will certify to the Secretary the amount to which the candidate is entitled on the regularly scheduled certification date for the original submission. Corrected submissions made after this five-day period will be reviewed subsequent to the next regularly scheduled submission date, and the Commission will certify to the Secretary the amount to which the candidate is entitled on the next regularly scheduled certification date. Each corrected submission shall only contain contributions previously submitted for matching in the returned submission and no new or additional contributions.\n\n(b) Acceptance of submission for review of matchability. If the Commission determines that a submission made under 11 CFR part 9036 satisfies the requirements of 11 CFR 9036.1(b) and 9036.2 (b), (c) and (d), and the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order, it will review the matchability of the contributions contained therein. The Commission, in conducting its review, may utilize statistical sampling techniques. Based on the results of its review, the Commission may calculate a matchable amount for the submission which is less than the amount requested by the candidate. If the Commission certifies for payment to the Secretary an amount that is less than the amount requested by the candidate in a particular submission, or reduces the amount of a subsequent certification to the Secretary by adjusting a previous certification made under 11 CFR 9036.2(c)(1), the Commission will notify the candidate in writing of the following:\n\n(1) The amount of the difference between the amount requested and the amount to be certified by the Commission;\n\n(2) The amount of each contribution and the corresponding contributor's name for each contribution that the Commission has rejected as nonmatchable and the reason that it is not matchable; or if statistical sampling is used, the estimated amount of contributions by type and the reason for rejection;\n\n(3) The amount of contributions that have been determined to be matchable and that the Commission will certify to the Secretary for payment; and\n\n(4) A statement that the candidate may supply the Commission with additional records or other information in the resubmission of any rejected contribution under 11 CFR 9036.5 in order to show that a rejected contribution is matchable under 11 CFR 9034.2.\n\n(c) Adjustment of amount to be certified by Commission. (1) The candidate shall notify the Commission as soon as possible if the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee(s) has knowledge that a contribution submitted for matching does not qualify under 11 CFR 9034.2 as a matchable contribution, such as a check returned to the committee for insufficient funds or a contribution that has been refunded, so that the Commission may properly adjust the amount to be certified for payment.\n\n(2) After the candidate's date of ineligibility, if the candidate does not receive the entire amount of matching funds on a regularly scheduled payment date due to a shortfall in the matching payment account, prior to each subsequent payment date on which the candidate receives payments from any previous certification, the Commission may revise the amount previously certified for payment pursuant to 11 CFR 9034.5(f). The Commission will promptly notify the Secretary and the candidate of any revision to the amount certified.\n\n(d) Commission audit of submissions. The Commission may determine, for the reasons stated in 11 CFR part 9039, that an audit and examination of contributions submitted for matching payment is warranted. The audit and examination shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures of 11 CFR part 9039.\n\n[56 FR 34133, July 25, 1991, as amended at 89 FR 221, Jan. 2, 2024]",

Upon receipt of the Commission's notice of the results of the submission review pursuant to 11 CFR 9036.4(b), or of an inquiry pursuant to 11 CFR 9039.3 that results in a downward adjustment to the amount of certified matching funds, a candidate may choose to:\n\n(1) Resubmit the entire submission; or\n\n(2) Make a written request for the identification of the specific contributions that were rejected for matching, and resubmit those specific contributions.\n\n(b) Time for presentation of resubmissions. If the candidate chooses to resubmit any contributions under 11 CFR 9036.5(a), the contributions shall be resubmitted on dates to be determined and published by the Commission. The candidate may not make any resubmissions later than the first Tuesday in September of the year following the Presidential election year.\n\n(c) Format for resubmissions.

In making a presentation of resubmitted contributions, the candidate shall follow the format requirements as specified in 11 CFR 9036.2(b)(1), except that:\n\n(1) The candidate need not provide photocopies of written instruments, supporting records and bank records unless it is necessary to supplement the original records.\n\n(2) Each resubmitted contribution shall be referenced to the submission in which it was first presented.\n\n(3) Each list of resubmitted contributions shall reflect the aggregate amount of contributions submitted for matching from each contributor as of the date of the original submission.\n\n(4) Each list of resubmitted contributions shall reflect the aggregate amount of contributions submitted for matching from each contributor as of the date of the resubmission.\n\n(5) Each list of resubmitted contributions shall only contain contributions previously submitted for matching and no new or additional contributions.\n\n(6) Each resubmission shall be accompanied by a statement that the candidate has corrected his or her contributor records (including the data base for those candidates maintaining their contributor list on computer).\n\n(d) Certification of resubmitted contributions. Contributions that the Commission determines to be matchable will be certified to the Secretary at least once a month on dates to be determined and published by the Commission. If the candidate chooses to request the specific contributions rejected for matching pursuant to 11 CFR 9036.5(a)(2), the amount certified shall equal only the matchable amount of the particular contribution that meets the standards on resubmission, rather than the amount projected as being nonmatchable based on that contribution due to the sampling techniques used in reviewing the original submission.\n\n(e) Initial determinations. If the candidate resubmits a contribution for matching and the Commission determines that the rejected contribution is still non-matchable, the Commission will notify the candidate in writing of its determination. The Commission will advise the candidate of the legal and factual reasons for its determination and of the evidence on which that determination is based. The candidate may submit written legal or factual materials to demonstrate that the contribution is matchable within 30 calendar days after service of the Commission's notice. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires.\n\n(f) Final determinations. The Commission will consider any written legal or factual materials timely submitted by the candidate in making its final determination. A final determination by the Commission that a contribution is not matchable will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons for the Commission's action. This statement will explain the reasons underlying the Commission's determination and will summarize the results of any investigation upon which the determination is based.\n\n[56 FR 34134, July 25, 1991 and 56 FR 35941, July 29, 1991; 60 FR 31885, June 16, 1995; 89 FR 221, Jan. 2, 2024]",

(1) If the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee does not maintain or use any computerized information containing the data listed in 11 CFR 9033.12, the Commission will give the candidate's authorized committee at least two weeks' notice of the Commission's intention to commence fieldwork on the audit and examination. The fieldwork shall be conducted at a site provided by the committee. If the candidate or the candidate's authorized committee maintains or uses computerized information containing any of the data listed in 11 CFR 9033.12, the Commission generally will request such information prior to commencement of audit fieldwork. Such request will be made in writing. The committee shall produce the computerized information no later than 15 calendar days after service of such request. Upon receipt of the computerized information requested and compliance with the technical specifications of 11 CFR 9033.12(b), the Commission will give the candidate's authorized committee at least two weeks' notice of the Commission's intention to commence fieldwork on the audit and examination. The fieldwork shall be conducted at a site provided by the committee. During or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may request additional or updated information which expands the coverage dates of computerized information previously provided, and which may be used for purposes including, but not limited to, updating a statement of net outstanding campaign obligations, or updating the amount chargeable to a state expenditure limit. During or after audit fieldwork, the Commission may also request additional computerized information which was created by or becomes available to the committee and that is of assistance in the Commission's audit. The committee shall produce the additional or updated computerized information no later than 15 calendar days after service of the Commission's request.\n\n(i) Office space and records. On the date scheduled for the commencement of fieldwork, the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) shall provide Commission staff with office space and committee records in accordance with the candidate and committee agreement under 11 CFR 9033.1(b)(6).\n\n(ii) Availability of committee personnel. On the date scheduled for the commencement of fieldwork, the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) shall have committee personnel present at the site of the fieldwork. Such personnel shall be familiar with the committee's records and operation and shall be available to Commission staff to answer questions and to aid in locating records.\n\n(iii) Failure to provide staff, records or office space. If the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) fail to provide adequate office space, personnel or committee records, the Commission may seek judicial intervention under 52 U.S.C. 30107 or 26 U.S.C. 9040(c) to enforce the candidate and committee agreement made under 11 CFR 9033.1(b). Before seeking judicial intervention, the Commission will notify the candidate of his or her failure to comply with the agreement and will recommend corrective action to bring the candidate into compliance. Upon receipt of the Commission's notification, the candidate will have 10 calendar days in which to take the corrective action indicated or to otherwise demonstrate to the Commission in writing that he or she is complying with the candidate and committee agreement.\n\n(iv) If, in the course of the audit process, a dispute arises over the records sought or other requirements of the candidate agreement, the candidate may seek review by the Commission of the issues raised. To seek review, the candidate shall submit a written statement, within 10 calendar days after the disputed Commission staff request is made, describing the dispute and indicating the candidate's proposed alternative(s).\n\n(v) If the candidate or his or her authorized committee fails to produce particular records, materials, evidence or other information requested by the Commission, the Commission may issue an order pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30107(a)(1) or a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum pursuant to 52 U.S.C. 30107(a)(3). The procedures set forth in 11 CFR 111.11 through 111.15, as appropriate, shall apply to the production of such records, materials, evidence or other information as specified in the order, subpoena or subpoena duces tecum.\n\n(2) Fieldwork will include the following steps designed to keep the candidate and committee informed as to the progress of the audit and to expedite the process:\n\n(i) Entrance conference. At the outset of the fieldwork, Commission staff will hold an entrance conference, at which the candidate's representatives will be advised of the purpose of the audit and the general procedures to be followed. Future requirements of the candidate and his or her authorized committee, such as possible repayments to the United States Treasury, will also be discussed. Committee representatives shall provide information and records necessary to conduct the audit, and Commission staff will be available to answer committee questions.\n\n(ii) Review of records. During the fieldwork, Commission staff will review committee records and may conduct interviews of committee personnel. Commission staff will be available to explain aspects of the audit and examination as it progresses. Additional meetings between Commission staff and committee personnel may be held from time to time during the fieldwork to discuss possible audit findings and to resolve issues arising during the course of the audit.\n\n(iii) Exit conference. At the conclusion of the fieldwork, Commission staff will hold an exit conference to discuss with committee representatives the staff's preliminary findings and recommendations that the staff anticipates it will present to the Commission for approval. Commission staff will advise committee representatives at this conference of the committee's opportunity to respond to these preliminary findings; the projected timetables regarding the issuance of the Preliminary Audit Report, the Audit Report, and any repayment determination; the committee's opportunity for an administrative review of any repayment determination; and the procedures involved in Commission repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9038.2.\n\n(3) Commission staff may conduct additional fieldwork after the completion of the fieldwork conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1(b) (1) and (2). Factors that may necessitate such follow-up fieldwork include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n(i) Committee responses to audit findings;\n\n(ii) Financial activity of the committee subsequent to the fieldwork conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1(b)(1);\n\n(iii) Committee responses to Commission repayment determinations made under 11 CFR 9038.2.\n\n(4) The Commission will notify the candidate and his or her authorized committee if follow-up fieldwork is necessary. The provisions of 11 CFR 9038.1(b) (1) and (2) shall apply to any additional fieldwork conducted.\n\n(c) Preliminary Audit Report: Issuance by Commission and committee response. (1) Commission staff will prepare a written Preliminary Audit Report, which will be provided to the committee after it is approved by an affirmative vote of four (4) members of the Commission. The Preliminary Audit Report may include—\n\n(i) An evaluation of procedures and systems employed by the candidate and committee to comply with applicable provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act, the Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act and Commission regulations;\n\n(ii) The accuracy of statements and reports filed with the Commission by the candidate and committee; and\n\n(iii) Preliminary calculations regarding future repayments to the United States Treasury.\n\n(2) The candidate and his or her authorized committee may submit in writing within 60 calendar days after receipt of the Preliminary Audit Report, legal and factual materials disputing or commenting on the proposed findings contained in the Preliminary Audit Report. In addition, the committee shall submit any additional records requested by the Commission. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires.\n\n(d) Approval and issuance of audit report. (1) Before voting on whether to issue and approve an audit report, the Commission will consider any written legal and factual materials timely submitted by the candidate or his or her authorized committee in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The Commission-approved audit report may address issues other than those contained in the Preliminary Audit Report. In addition, this report will contain a repayment determination made by the Commission pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.2(c)(1).\n\n(2) The audit report may contain issues that warrant referral to the Office of General Counsel for possible enforcement proceedings under 52 U.S.C. 30109 and 11 CFR part 111.\n\n(3) Addenda to the audit report may be approved and issued by the Commission from time to time as circumstances warrant and as additional information becomes available. Such addenda may be based on follow-up fieldwork conducted under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and/or information ascertained by the Commission in the normal course of carrying out its supervisory responsibilities. The procedures set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d) (1) and (2) of this section will be followed in preparing such addenda. The addenda will be placed on the public record as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. Such addenda may also include additional repayment determination(s).\n\n(e) Public release of audit report. (1) The Commission will consider the audit report in an open session agenda document. The Commission will provide the candidate and the committee with copies of any agenda document to be considered in an open session 24 hours prior to releasing the agenda document to the public.\n\n(2) Following Commission approval of the audit report, the report will be forwarded to the committee and released to the public. The Commission will provide the candidate and committee with copies of the audit report approved by the Commission 24 hours before releasing the report to the public.\n\n(f)(1) Sampling. In conducting an audit of contributions pursuant to this section, the Commission may utilize generally accepted statistical sampling techniques to quantify, in whole or in part, the dollar value of related audit findings. A projection of the total amount of violations based on apparent violations identified in such a sample may become the basis, in whole or in part, of any audit finding.\n\n(2) A committee in responding to a sample-based finding concerning excessive or prohibited contributions shall respond only to the specific sample items used to make the projection. If the committee demonstrates that any apparent errors found among the sample items were not errors, the Commission shall make a new projection based on the reduced number of errors in the sample.\n\n(3) Within 30 days of service of the Final Audit Report, the committee shall submit a check to the United States Treasury for the total amount of any excessive or prohibited contributions not refunded, reattributed or redesignated in a timely manner in accordance with 11 CFR 103.3(b) (1), (2) or (3); or take any other action required by the Commission with respect to sample-based findings.\n\n[56 FR 35945, July 29, 1991; 56 FR 42380, Aug. 27, 1991; 60 FR 31885, June 16, 1995; 64 FR 61781, Nov. 15, 1999; 79 FR 77852, Dec. 29, 2014; 89 FR 221, Jan. 2, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. (1) A candidate who has received payments from the matching payment account shall pay the United States Treasury any amounts which the Commission determines to be repayable under this section. In making repayment determinations under this section, the Commission may utilize information obtained from audits and examinations conducted pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1 and part 9039 or otherwise obtained by the Commission in carrying out its responsibilities under this subchapter.\n\n(2) The Commission will notify the candidate of any repayment determinations made under this section as soon as possible, but not later than 3 years after the close of the matching payment period. The Commission's issuance of the audit report to the candidate under 11 CFR 9038.1(d) will constitute notification for purposes of this section.\n\n(3) Once the candidate receives notice of the Commission's repayment determination under this section, the candidate should give preference to the repayment over all other outstanding obligations of his or her committee, except for any federal taxes owned by the committee.\n\n(4) Repayments may be made only from the following sources: personal funds of the candidate (without regard to the limitations of 11 CFR 9035.2), contributions and federal funds in the committee's account(s), and any additional funds raised subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended.\n\n(b) Bases for repayment—(1) Payments in excess of candidate's entitlement. The Commission may determine that certain portions of the payments made to a candidate from the matching payment account were in excess of the aggregate amount of payments to which such candidate was entitled. Examples of such excessive payments include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n(i) Payments made to the candidate after the candidate's date of ineligibility where it is later determined that the candidate had no net outstanding campaign obligations as defined in 11 CFR 9034.5;\n\n(ii) Payments or portions of payments made to the candidate which are later determined to have been excessive due to the operation of the Commission's expedited payment procedures as set forth in the Federal Election Commission's Guideline for Presentation in Good Order;\n\n(iii) Payments or portions of payments made on the basis of matched contributions later determined to have been non-matchable;\n\n(iv) Payments or portions of payments made to the candidate which are later determined to have been excessive due to the candidate's failure to include funds received by a fundraising representative committee under 11 CFR 9034.8 on the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations under 11 CFR 9034.5; and\n\n(v) Payments or portions of payments made to the candidate on the basis of the debts reflected in the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations, which debts are later settled for an amount less than that stated in the statement of net outstanding campaign obligations.\n\n(2) Use of funds for non-qualified campaign expenses. (i) The Commission may determine that amount(s) of any payments made to a candidate from the matching payment account were used for purposes other than those set forth in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A)-(C) of this section:\n\n(A) Defrayal of qualified campaign expenses;\n\n(B) Repayment of loans which were used to defray qualified campaign expenses; and\n\n(C) Restoration of funds (other than contributions which were received and expended to defray qualified campaign expenses) which were used to defray qualified campaign expenses.\n\n(ii) Examples of Commission repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2) include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n(A) Determinations that a candidate, a candidate's authorized committee(s) or agents have made expenditures in excess of the limitations set forth in 11 CFR part 9035;\n\n(B) Determinations that funds described in 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2)(i) were expended in violation of State or Federal law;\n\n(C) Determinations that funds described in 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2)(i) were expended for expenses resulting from a violation of State or Federal law, such as the payment of fines or penalties; and\n\n(D) Determinations that funds described in 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2)(i) were expended for costs associated with continuing to campaign after the candidate's date of ineligibility.\n\n(iii) The amount of any repayment sought under this section shall bear the same ratio to the total amount determined to have been used for non-qualified campaign expenses as the amount of matching funds certified to the candidate bears to the candidate's total deposits, as of 90 days after the candidate's date of ineligibility. For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)—\n\n(A) Total deposits is defined in accordance with 11 CFR 9038.3(c)(2); and\n\n(B) In seeking repayment for non-qualified campaign expenses from committees that have received matching fund payments after the candidate's date of ineligibility, the Commission will review committee expenditures to determine at what point committee accounts no longer contain matching funds. In doing this, the Commission will review committee expenditures from the date of the last matching fund payment to which the candidate was entitled, using the assumption that the last payment has been expended on a last-in, first-out basis.\n\n(iv) Repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2) will include all non-qualified campaign expenses paid before the point when committee accounts no longer contain matching funds, including non-qualified campaign expenses listed on the candidate's statement of net outstanding campaign obligations that may result in a separate repayment determination under 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(1).\n\n(v) If a candidate or a candidate's authorized committee(s) exceeds both the overall expenditure limitation and one or more State expenditure limitations, as set forth at 11 CFR 9035.1(a), the repayment determination under 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2)(ii)(A) shall be based on only the larger of either the amount exceeding the State expenditure limitation(s) or the amount exceeding the overall expenditure limitation.\n\n(3) Failure to provide adequate records. The Commission may determine that amount(s) spent by the candidate, the candidate's authorized committee(s), or agents were not documented in accordance with 11 CFR 9033.11. The amount of any repayment sought under this section shall be determined by using the formula set forth in 11 CFR 9038.2(b)(2)(iii).\n\n(4) The Commission may determine that the candidate's net outstanding campaign obligations, as defined in 11 CFR 9034.5, reflect a surplus. The Commission may determine that the net income derived from an investment or other use of surplus public funds after the candidate's date of ineligibility, less Federal, State and local taxes paid on such income, shall be paid to the Treasury.\n\n(c) Repayment determination procedures. The Commission's repayment determination will be made in accordance with the procedures set forth at paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section.\n\n(1) Repayment determination. The Commission will provide the candidate with a written notice of its repayment determination(s). This notice will be included in the Commission's audit report prepared pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1(d), or inquiry report pursuant to 11 CFR 9039.3, and will set forth the legal and factual reasons for such determination(s), as well as the evidence upon which any such determination is based. The candidate shall repay to the United States Treasury in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the amount which the Commission has determined to be repayable.\n\n(2) Administrative review of repayment determination. If a candidate disputes the Commission's repayment determination(s), he or she may request an administrative review of the determination(s) as set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.\n\n(i) Submission of written materials. A candidate who disputes the Commission's repayment determination(s) shall submit in writing, within 60 calendar days after service of the Commission's notice, legal and factual materials demonstrating that no repayment, or a lesser repayment, is required. Such materials may be submitted by counsel if the candidate so desires. The candidate's failure to timely raise an issue in written materials presented pursuant to this paragraph will be deemed a waiver of the candidate's right to raise the issue at any future stage of proceedings including any petition for review filed under 26 U.S.C. 9041(a).\n\n(ii) Oral hearing. A candidate who submits written materials pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section may at the same time request in writing that the Commission provide such candidate with an opportunity to address the Commission in open session to demonstrate that no repayment, or a lesser repayment, is required. The candidate should identify in this request the repayment issues he or she wants to address at the oral hearing. If the Commission decides by an affirmative vote of four (4) of its members to grant the candidate's request, it will inform the candidate of the date and time set for the oral hearing. At the date and time set by the Commission, the candidate or candidate's designated representative will be allotted an amount of time in which to make an oral presentation to the Commission based upon the legal and factual materials submitted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The candidate or representative will also have the opportunity to answer any questions from individual members of the Commission.\n\n(3) Repayment determination upon review. In deciding whether to revise any repayment determination(s) following an administrative review pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Commission will consider any submission made under paragraph (c)(2)(i) and any oral hearing conducted under paragraph (c)(2)(ii), and may also consider any new or additional information from other sources. A determination following an administrative review that a candidate must repay a certain amount will be accompanied by a written statement of reasons supporting the Commission's determination(s). This statement will explain the legal and factual reasons underlying the Commission's determination(s) and will summarize the results of any investigation(s) upon which the determination(s) are based.\n\n(d) Repayment period. (1) Within 90 calendar days of service of the notice of the Commission's repayment determination(s), the candidate shall repay to the United States Treasury the amounts which the Commission has determined to be repayable. Upon application by the candidate, the Commission may grant an extension of up to 90 calendar days in which to make repayment.\n\n(2) If the candidate requests an administrative review of the Commission's repayment determination(s) under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the time for repayment will be suspended until the Commission has concluded its administrative review of the repayment determination(s). Within 30 calendar days after service of the notice of the Commission's post-administrative review repayment determination(s), the candidate shall repay to the United States Treasury the amounts which the Commission has determined to be repayable. Upon application by the candidate, the Commission may grant an extension of up to 90 calendar days in which to make repayment.\n\n(3) Interest shall be assessed on all repayments made after the initial 90-day repayment period established at paragraph (d)(1) of this section or the 30-day repayment period established at paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The amount of interest due shall be the greater of:\n\n(i) An amount calculated in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1961 (a) and (b); or\n\n(ii) The amount actually earned on the funds set aside under this section.\n\n(e) Computation of time. The time periods established by this section shall be computed in accordance with 11 CFR 111.2.\n\n(f) Additional repayments. Nothing in this section will prevent the Commission from making additional repayment determinations on one or more of the bases set forth at 11 CFR 9038.2(b) after it has made a repayment determination on any such basis. The Commission may make additional repayment determinations where there exist facts not used as the basis for any previous determination. Any such additional repayment determination will be made in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n\n(g) Newly-discovered assets. If, after any repayment determination made under this section, a candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) receives or becomes aware of assets not previously included in any statement of net outstanding campaign obligations submitted pursuant to 11 CFR 9034.5, the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s) shall promptly notify the Commission of such newly-discovered assets. Newly-discovered assets may include refunds, rebates, late-arriving receivables, and actual receipts for capital assets in excess of the value specified in any previously-submitted statement of net outstanding campaign obligations. Newly-discovered assets may serve as a basis for additional repayment determinations under 11 CFR 9038.2(f).\n\n(h) Petitions for rehearing; stays pending appeal. The candidate may file a petition for rehearing of a repayment determination in accordance with 11 CFR 9038.5(a). The candidate may request a stay of a repayment determination in accordance with 11 CFR 9038.5(c) pending the candidate's appeal of that repayment determination.\n\n[56 FR 35945, July 29, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 31886, June 16, 1995; 60 FR 57538, 57539, Nov. 16, 1995; 61 FR 69020, Dec. 31, 1996; 68 FR 47421, Aug. 8, 2003; 89 FR 221, Jan. 2, 2024]",

The amount shall be an amount equal to that portion of the surplus which bears the same ratio to the total surplus that the total amount received by the candidate from the matching payment account bears to the total deposits made to the candidate's accounts.\n\n(2) For purposes of this subsection, total deposits means all deposits to all candidate accounts minus transfers between accounts, refunds, rebates, reimbursements, checks returned for insufficient funds, proceeds of loans and other similar amounts.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the payment of any amounts to the United States Treasury under this section, the Commission may make surplus repayment determination(s) which require repayment in accordance with 11 CFR 9038.2.",

The candidate shall demonstrate in the application for extension that good cause exists for his or her request.\n\n(c) An application for extension of time shall be made at least 7 calendar days prior to the expiration of the time period for which the extension is sought. The Commission may, upon a showing of good cause, grant an extension of time to a candidate who has applied for such extension in a timely manner. The length of time of any extension granted hereunder will be decided by the Commission and may be less than the amount of time sought by the candidate in his or her application.

(1) Following the Commission's final determination under 11 CFR 9033.10 or 9034.5(g) or the Commission's repayment determination under 11 CFR 9038.2(c), the candidate may file a petition for rehearing setting forth the relief desired and the legal and factual basis in support. To be considered by the Commission, petitions for rehearing must:\n\n(i) Be filed within 20 calendar days after service of the Commission's final determination or repayment determination;\n\n(ii) Raise new questions of law or fact that would materially alter the Commission's final determination or repayment determination; and\n\n(iii) Set forth clear and convincing grounds why such questions were not and could not have been presented during the original determination process.\n\n(2) If a candidate files a timely petition under this section challenging a Commission repayment determination, the time for repayment of the amount at issue will be suspended until the Commission serves notice on the candidate of its determination on the petition.

An issue is not timely raised in a petition for rehearing if it could have been raised earlier in response to the Commission's original determination.\n\n(c) Stay of repayment determination pending appeal.

Matching payments will not be withheld pending the results of an inquiry under this section unless the Commission finds patent irregularities suggesting the possibility of fraud in materials submitted by, or in the activities of, the candidate or his or her authorized committee(s).\n\n(b) Procedures. (1) The Commission will notify the candidate of its decision to conduct an inquiry under this section. The notice will summarize the legal and factual basis for the Commission's decision.\n\n(2) The Commission's inquiry may include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n(i) A field audit of the candidate's books and records;\n\n(ii) Field interviews of agents and representatives of the candidate and his or her authorized committee(s);\n\n(iii) Verification of reported contributions by contacting reported contributors;\n\n(iv) Verification of disbursement information by contacting reported vendors;\n\n(v) Written questions under order;\n\n(vi) Production of records under subpoena;\n\n(vii) Depositions.\n\n(3) The provisions of 52 U.S.C. 30109 and 11 CFR part 111 will not apply to inquiries conducted under this section except that the provisions of 11 CFR 111.12 through 111.15 shall apply to any orders or subpoenas issued by the Commission.\n\n(4) If, at the close of the inquiry, the Commission determines that no action or no further action is warranted, the Commission shall so notify the candidate. If the inquiry results in an adjustment to the amount of certified matching funds, the procedures set forth at 11 CFR 9036.5 or 9038.1 shall be followed, as appropriate. If the inquiry coincides with an audit undertaken pursuant to 11 CFR 9038.1, the information obtained in the inquiry will be utilized in making the repayment determination. If the inquiry results in an initial or additional repayment determination, the procedures set forth at 11 CFR 9038.2, 9038.4, and 9038.5 shall be followed.\n\n[56 FR 35949, July 29, 1991; 56 FR 42380, Aug. 27, 1991; 60 FR 31888, June 16, 1995; 79 FR 77852, Dec. 29, 2014; 89 FR 221, Jan. 2, 2024]",

    "content": "As used in this part, the term—\n\nChief FOIA Officer means the person designated under § 9405.3(d) who has Commission-wide responsibility for the efficient and appropriate compliance with the FOIA.\n\nCommercial use request means a FOIA request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his/her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The FOIA Officer will determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the requested documents. Where the FOIA Officer has reasonable cause to doubt the use for which the requester claims to have made the FOIA request or where that use is not clear from the FOIA request itself, the FOIA Officer will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.\n\nCommission means the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, established by the Help America Vote Act of 2002, 42 U.S.C. 15301 et seq.\n\nCommissioner means an individual appointed to the Commission by the President and confirmed by the Senate under section 203 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, 42 U.S.C. 15323.\n\nDirect costs means those expenditures which the Commission actually incurs in searching for, duplicating, and, in the case of commercial use requesters, reviewing documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, but are not limited to, the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that basic rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating equipment. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses, such as the cost of space and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.\n\nDuplication means the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Examples of the form such copies can take include, but are not limited to, paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape, DVD, or CD). The Commission will honor a requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the records requested are reasonably reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format.\n\nEducational institution means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institute of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.\n\nExecutive Director means the Executive Director of the Commission or his or her designee.\n\nFOIA means Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.\n\nFOIA Officer means a person designated by the Chief FOIA Officer under § 9405.3(d) to carry out day-to-day implementation of the FOIA activities of the Commission.\n\nFOIA Public Liaison means a person designated by the Chief FOIA Officer under § 9405.3(d) to assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and the Commission.\n\nFOIA request means to seek the release of records under 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.\n\nGeneral Counsel means the General Counsel of the Commission or his or her designee.\n\nNon-commercial scientific institution means an organization that is not operated on a commercial basis and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.\n\nRecord means any information that would be a Commission record subject to the requirements of this part when maintained by the Commission in any format, including, but not limited to, an electronic format. Record includes information that is maintained for the Commission by an entity under Government contract for the purposes of records management.\n\nRepresentative of the news media means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. As used in this paragraph, “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include, but are not limited to, television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, web logs, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances in which these entities can qualify as disseminators of news, as defined in this paragraph) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. As used in this paragraph, a “web log” means a publicly available Web site, usually maintained by an individual, with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other material. A freelance journalist may be regarded as working for a news media entity and therefore, considered a representative of the news media if that person can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication by a news organization (whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity). A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation. The Commission may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making this determination.\n\nRequester is any person who submits a FOIA request to the Commission for release of a record under 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.\n\nReview means the process of examining a document located in response to a commercial use request to determine whether any portion of the document located is exempt from disclosure. Review also refers to processing any document for disclosure, i.e., doing all that is necessary to excise exempt portions of the document or otherwise prepare the document for release. Review time includes time spent considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a business submitter requesting confidential treatment but does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.\n\nSearch means all time spent reviewing, manually or by automated means, Commission records for the purpose of locating those records that are responsive to a FOIA request, including, but not limited to, page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format. Search time does not include review of material to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure.",

The Chief FOIA Officer shall designate one or more Commission officials, as appropriate, as FOIA Public Liaison and/or as FOIA Officers. A FOIA Public Liaison shall serve as a supervisory official to whom a FOIA requester can raise questions about the service the FOIA requester has received.

For purposes of this section, trade secret means a secret, commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making, preparing, compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product of either innovation or substantial effort. Examples of trade secrets may include, but are not limited to, plans, schematics, specifications of materials used in production, source code used to develop software, technical descriptions of manufacturing process, quality control methodology, and test results. The following procedures shall be used for submitting business information in confidence:\n\n(i) Clearly mark any portion of any data or information being submitted that in the submitter's opinion is a trade secret or commercial and financial information that the submitter is claiming should be treated as privileged and confidential and submit such data or information separately from other material being submitted to the Commission;\n\n(ii) A request for confidential treatment shall be addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer, U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1335 East-West Highway, Suite 4300, Silver Spring, MD 20910 and shall indicate clearly on the envelope that it is a request for confidential treatment.\n\n(iii) With each submission of, or offer to submit, business information which a submitter desires to be treated as confidential under paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the submitter shall provide the following, which may be disclosed to the public:\n\n(A) A written description of the nature of the subject information and a justification for the request for its confidential treatment, and\n\n(B) A certification in writing under oath that substantially identical information is not available to the public.\n\n(iv) Approval or denial of requests shall be made only by the Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designees. A denial shall be in writing, shall specify the reason for the denial, and shall advise the submitter of the right to appeal to the Commission.\n\n(v) For good cause shown, the Commission may grant an appeal from a denial by the Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designee if the appeal is filed within 15 days after receipt of the denial. An appeal shall be addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer, U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1335 East-West Highway, Suite 4300, Silver Spring, MD 20910 and shall clearly indicate that it is a confidential submission appeal. An appeal will be decided within 20 days after its receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) unless an extension, stated in writing with the reasons therefore, has been provided to the person making the appeal.\n\n(vi) Any business information submitted in confidence and determined to be entitled to confidential treatment shall be maintained in confidence by the Commission and not disclosed except as required by law.

The amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion is made shall be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by an exemption in paragraph (a) of this section under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of the information deleted shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made.\n\n(c) If a requested record is one of another government agency or deals with subject matter to which a government agency other than the Commission has exclusive or primary responsibility, the request for such a record shall be promptly referred by the Commission to that agency for disposition or guidance as to disposition.\n\n(d) Nothing in this part authorizes withholding of information or limiting the availability of records to the public, except as specifically provided; nor is this part authority to withhold information from Congress.\n\n[73 FR 54257, Sept. 18, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 49814, Aug. 16, 2010; 83 FR 53802, Oct. 25, 2018]",

The 20-day period shall commence on the date on which the request was first received by the appropriate component of the Commission, but in any event, not later than 10 days after the request is first received by the component of the Commission designated to receive requests under this part.

Remittance shall be made payable to the order of the Treasury of the United States and mailed to the Chief FOIA Officer, U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1225 New York Avenue, NW., Suite 1100, Washington, DC 20005.\n\n(h) Receipt of fees. A receipt for fees paid will be given upon request. Refund of fees paid for services actually rendered will not be made.\n\n(i) Restrictions on assessing fees. The Commission shall not assess search fees or duplication fees under this paragraph if the Commission fails to comply with any time limit in these regulations. The Commission will not charge fees to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself. With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, the Commission will not charge fees for the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time.\n\n(1) The elements to be considered in determining the “cost of collecting a fee” are the administrative costs of receiving and recording a requester's remittance and processing the fee for deposit in the Treasury Department's special account.\n\n(2) For purposes of these restrictions on assessment of fees, the word “pages” means paper copies of 8.5″ × 11″ or 11″ × 14″. Thus, requesters are not entitled to 100 computer disks, for example.\n\n(3) For purposes of these restrictions on assessment of fees, the term “search time” means manual search. To apply this term to searches made by computer, the Commission will determine the hourly cost of operating the CPU and the operator's hourly salary plus 16 percent. When the cost of such search (including operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process a request) equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of salary of the person performing the search (i.e., the operator), the Commission will begin assessing charges for computer search.",

    "content": "There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters.\n\n(a) Commercial use requesters. When the Commission receives a request for documents for commercial use, it will assess charges that recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the record sought. Commercial use requesters are neither entitled to two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of duplication. The Commission may recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records (see § 9405.11(b)).\n\n(b) Educational and non-commercial scientific institution requesters. The Commission shall provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the record is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought in the furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research.\n\n(c) Representatives of the news media. The Commission shall provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, the requester must fit the definition of a representative of the news media as stated in § 9405.2, and the request must not be made for commercial use. For purposes of this paragraph, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for commercial use.\n\n(d) All other requesters. The Commission shall charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above fees that recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge.",

    "content": "(a) Charging Interest—notice and rate. The Commission may begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. The fact that the fee has been received by the Commission within the 30-day grace period, even if it is not processed, will suffice to stay the accrual of interest. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 of the United States Code and will accrue from the date of the billing.\n\n(b) Charges for unsuccessful search. The Commission may assess charges for time spent searching, even if it fails to locate the records or if the records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. If the Commission estimates that search charges are likely to exceed $25, it shall notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a notice shall offer the requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.\n\n(c) Aggregating requests. A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Commission reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requestors acting in concert has submitted requests that constitute a single request involving clearly related matters, the Commission may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. One element to be considered in determining whether a belief would be reasonable is the time period over which the requests have occurred.\n\n(d) Advance payments. The Commission may not require a requester to make an advance payment (i.e., payment before work is commenced or continued on a request) unless:\n\n(1) The Commission estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. Then, the Commission will notify the requester of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees or require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charges in the case of requesters with no history of payment; or\n\n(2) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion (i.e., within 30 days of the date of the billing). Then, the Commission may require the requester to:\n\n(i) Pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided above or demonstrate that he or she has, in fact, paid the fee, and\n\n(ii) Make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the agency begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requester.\n\n(3) When the Commission acts under paragraphs (d)(1) or (2) of this section, the administrative time limits prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) will begin only after the Commission has received payments described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.\n\n(e) Effect of Debt Collection Act of 1982. The Commission shall comply with the provisions of the Debt Collection Act, including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage repayment.",

If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Commission will take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such a burden but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped person receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.\n\n(b) Methods. The Commission may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The Commission is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The Commission, in making alterations to existing buildings will meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4151-4157, and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the Commission will give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.\n\n(c) Time period for compliance. The Commission shall comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty days of the effective date of this part except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes will be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.\n\n(d) Transition plan.
