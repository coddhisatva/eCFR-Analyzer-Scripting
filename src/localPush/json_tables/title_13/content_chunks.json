    "content": "(a) General information. (1) The SBA has a decentralized system for responding to FOIA requests, with each component handling requests for its records. All components have the capability to receive requests electronically either through email or a web portal. To make a request for records, a requester should write directly to the Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOI/PA) Office by mail to 409 3rd St SW., Washington, DC 20416 or submit a fax to 202-205-7059 or email to foia@sba.gov. Requesters may also submit their request through the FOIA online portal at https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/foia/action/public/home. Additional information for submitting a request to SBA is listed at https://www.sba.gov/foia. However, a request will receive the quickest possible response if it is addressed to the component that maintains the records sought.\n\n(2) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself must comply with the verification of identity provision set forth in subpart B of this part. The Certification of Identity form, available at http://www.justice.gov/oip/forms/cert_ind.pdf, may be used by individuals who are making requests for records pertaining to themselves.\n\n(3) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, each component can require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.\n\n(b) Description of records sought. Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable agency personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may help the component in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, reference number, the timeframe for which the records are sought, the office that created the records, or any other information that will assist the component in locating documents responsive to the request. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the component's FOIA Contact or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records. If, after receiving a request, a component determines that the request does not adequately describe the records sought, the component will inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. The component will also notify the requester that it will not be able to comply with their request unless the additional information it has requested is received from them in writing within 20 working days after the component has requested it. If this type of notification is received, a requester may wish to discuss it with the FOIA Public Liaison. If the component does not receive a written response containing the additional information within 20 working days after it has been requested, the SBA will presume that the requester is no longer interested in the records and will close the file on the request. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the component's designated FOIA Contact or its FOIA Public Liaison, or a representative of the FOI/PA Office, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the SBA's response to the request may be delayed.\n\n(c) Form or format. Requests may specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) for the records sought. The SBA will accommodate the request if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format.\n\n(d) Contact information. Requesters must provide contact information, such as their phone number, email address, and mailing address, to assist the SBA in communicating with the requester and providing the released records.",

    "content": "(a) In general. Except in the instances described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the component that first receives a request for a record and maintains that record is the component responsible for responding to the request. In determining which records are responsive to a request, a component ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the component shall inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to a request.\n\n(b) Authority to grant or deny requests. The head of a component, or designee, is authorized to grant or to deny any requests for records that are maintained by that component.\n\n(c) Re-routing of misdirected requests. Where a component determines that a request was misdirected within the SBA, the receiving component shall route the request to the proper component(s).\n\n(d) Consultation, referral, and coordination. When reviewing records located by a component in response to a request, the component shall determine whether another component of SBA or another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the component shall proceed in one of the following ways:\n\n(1) Consultation. When records originated with the component processing the request, but contain within them information of interest to another component, agency, or other Federal Government office, the component processing the request should typically consult with that other component or agency prior to making a release determination.\n\n(2) Referral. (i) When the component processing the request believes that a different component, agency, or other Federal Government office is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the component typically should refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record, as long as the referral is to a component or agency that is subject to the FOIA. Ordinarily, the component or agency that originated the record will be presumed to be best able to make the disclosure determination. However, if the component processing the request and the originating component or agency jointly agrees that the former is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.\n\n(ii) Whenever a component refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another component or agency, it shall document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name(s) of the component or agency to which the record was referred, including that component's or agency's FOIA Contact information.\n\n(3) Coordination. The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the component or agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement component responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if a component locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the component that received the request should coordinate with the originating component or agency to seek its views on the disclosure of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by the component that originally received the request.\n\n(e) Classified information. On receipt of any request involving classified information, the component shall determine whether the information is currently and properly classified and take appropriate action to ensure compliance. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another component or agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the receiving component shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the component or agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever a component's record contains information that has been derivatively classified (for example, when it contains information classified by another component or agency), the component shall refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the component or agency that classified the underlying information.\n\n(f) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. Components of SBA may establish agreements with other components of SBA or other Federal agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.\n\n(g) Timing of responses to consultations and referrals. All consultations and referrals received by the SBA will be handled according to the date that the FOIA request initially was received by the first component or agency.",

    "content": "(a) In general. Components ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt. In instances involving misdirected requests that are re-routed pursuant to § 102.4(c), the response time will commence on the date that the request is received by the proper component's office that is designated to receive requests, but in any event not later than 10 working days after the request is first received by any component's office that is designated by these regulations to receive requests.\n\n(b) Multitrack processing. All components will designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. A component may also designate additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors that may be considered are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. Components shall advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, should offer the requester an opportunity to narrow or modify the request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.\n\n(c) Unusual circumstances. Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the component extends the time limit on that basis, the component shall, before expiration of the 20-working day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which the component estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the component shall, as prescribed by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or to arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The component shall make available its designated FOIA Contact or its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. The component must also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services.\n\n(d) Aggregating requests. For the purposes of determining unusual circumstances under the FOIA, components may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. Components shall not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.\n\n(e) Expedited processing. (1) Requests and appeals shall be processed on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:\n\n(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;\n\n(ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information.\n\n(iii) The loss of substantial due process rights; or\n\n(iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.\n\n(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. Requests based on paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section must be submitted to the component that maintains the records requested. When making a request for expedited processing of an administrative appeal, the request should be submitted to the FOI/PA Office. Requests for expedited processing that are based on paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section must be submitted to the component processing the request. A component that receives a misdirected request for expedited processing under the standard set forth in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section shall forward it immediately to the FOI/PA Office for its determination. The time period for making the determination on the request for expedited processing under paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section shall commence on the date that the FOI/PA Office receives the request, provided that it is routed within 10 working days.\n\n(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a notarized statement, such as an affidavit or declaration, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the SBA may waive the formal certification requirement.\n\n(4) A component shall notify the requester within 10 working days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request must be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and must be processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.",

A component shall acknowledge the request in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number. Components shall include in the acknowledgment a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.\n\n(c) Estimated dates of completion and interim responses. Upon request, components shall provide an estimated date by which they expect to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material, or searches in multiple locations, the SBA or component may provide interim responses, releasing the records on a rolling basis.\n\n(d) Grants of requests. Once a component determines it will grant a request in full or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. The component shall inform the requester of any fees charged under § 102.8 and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The component must inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.\n\n(e) Adverse determinations of requests. A component making an adverse determination denying a request in any respect shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters, denials of requests for expedited processing, and decisions where:\n\n(1) The requested record is exempt, in whole or in part;\n\n(2) The request does not reasonably describe the records sought;\n\n(3) The information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA;\n\n(4) The requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or\n\n(5) The requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester.\n\n(f) Content of denial. The denial must be signed by the head of the component or designee and must include:\n\n(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;\n\n(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied by the component in denying the request;\n\n(3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;\n\n(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 102.9, and a description of the appeal requirements; and\n\n(5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the component's FOIA Public Liaison or designee, and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.\n\n(g) Markings on released documents. Records disclosed in part must be marked clearly to show the amount of information deleted and the exemption under which the deletion was made unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.",

    "content": "(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section:\n\nConfidential commercial information means commercial or financial information obtained by the SBA from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).\n\nSubmitter means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides information, either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.\n\n(b) Designation of confidential commercial information. A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations shall expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.\n\n(c) When notice to submitters is required. (1) A component shall promptly provide written notice to a submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if, after reviewing the request, the responsive records, and any appeal by the requester, the component determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:\n\n(i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or\n\n(ii) The component has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure under that exemption or any other applicable exemption.\n\n(2) The notice shall either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish it.\n\n(d) Exceptions to submitter notice requirements. The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:\n\n(1) The component determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA;\n\n(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;\n\n(3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or\n\n(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case, the component shall give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information and must provide that notice within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.\n\n(e) Opportunity to object to disclosure. (1) A component shall specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced above. If the submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide the component a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as the basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.\n\n(2) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information received by the component after the date of any disclosure decision shall not be considered by the component. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.\n\n(f) Analysis of objections. A component shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.\n\n(g) Notice of intent to disclose. Whenever a component decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the component shall provide the submitter written notice, which shall include:\n\n(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;\n\n(2) A description of the information to be disclosed; and\n\n(3) A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time subsequent to the notice.",

    "content": "(a) In general. Components shall charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, a component may contact a requester for additional information. Components shall ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. A component ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Small Business Administration, addressed to the component assessing the fee.\n\n(b) Categories of requesters. Different fees are assessed depending on the requester category. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. Requests for fee waivers will be considered in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (l) of this section. For purposes of assessing fees, the FOIA establishes four categories of requesters:\n\n(1) Commercial use requesters;\n\n(2) Non-commercial scientific/educational institutions requesters;\n\n(3) News media requesters, and;\n\n(4) All other requesters.\n\n(c) Definitions. For purposes of this section:\n\n(1) Commercial use request is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. A component's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information.\n\n(2) Direct costs are those expenses that the SBA incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work (i.e., the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility. This will be in addition to search, review, and duplication fees, and shall be paid by requesters categorized as commercial and other.\n\n(3) Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.\n\n(4) Educational institution is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. Components may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and will advise requesters of their placement in this category.\n\n(5) Noncommercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use.\n\n(6) Representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the Internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, a requester's past publication record will be considered in making a determination.\n\n(7) Review is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 102.7, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.\n\n(8) Search is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.\n\n(d) Charging fees. In responding to FOIA requests, components will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (l) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, components will not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.\n\n(1) Search. (i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. Search fees shall be charged for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (e) of this section. Components may properly charge for time spent searching even if they do not locate any responsive records or if they determine that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.\n\n(ii) For each hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be charged as follows: Professional (GS 9-14)—$46; and managerial (GS 15 and above)—$83.\n\n(iii) Requesters shall be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. Requesters shall be notified of the costs associated with creating such a program and must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.\n\n(iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by SBA at a Federal Records Center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), additional costs shall be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.\n\n(2) Duplication. Duplication fees will be assessed to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (e) of this section. A component shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it can be readily reproduced in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, SBA will provide one copy per request at the cost of $.10 per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, SBA will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester must also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, components shall charge the direct costs.\n\n(3) Review. (i) Review fees will be assessed to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record, i.e., the review conducted by a component to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with SBA's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.\n\n(ii) The following table summarizes the fees for each type of requester.\n\nTable 1 to § 102.8—Summary of Fees\n\n(e) Restrictions on charging fees. (1) When a component determines that a requester is an educational institution, non-commercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media, and the records are not sought for commercial use, it will not charge search fees.\n\n(i) If a component fails to comply with the time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this section.\n\n(ii) If a component has determined that unusual circumstances as defined by the FOIA apply and SBA provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 working days.\n\n(iii) If a component has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the component may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. The component shall provide a timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and SBA must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, the component may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.\n\n(iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.\n\n(2) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.\n\n(3) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, components shall provide without charge:\n\n(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and\n\n(ii) The first two hours of search.\n\n(4) No fee will be charged when the total fee, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, is equal to or less than $46.00.\n\n(f) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $46.00. (1) When a component determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $46.00, the component shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review, or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the component shall advise the requester accordingly. If the request is not for noncommercial use, the notice will specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and will advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.\n\n(2) In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $46.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. Components are not required to accept payments in installments.\n\n(3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the component estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the component will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The component shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.\n\n(4) Components shall make available their FOIA Public Liaison or other designee to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.\n\n(g) Charges for other services. Although not required to provide special services, if a component chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.\n\n(h) Charging interest. Components may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the component. Components shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.\n\n(i) Aggregating requests. When a component reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the component may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. Components may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, components shall aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.\n\n(j) Advance payments. (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this section, components cannot require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed (i.e., payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.\n\n(2) When a component determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. Components may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.\n\n(3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any component or SBA within 30 working days of the billing date, a component may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and the component may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before SBA begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. When a component has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.\n\n(4) In cases in which advanced payment is required, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 working days after the date of the fee determination, the request will be closed.\n\n(k) Other statutes specifically providing for fees. The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires SBA to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the requester will be informed of the contact information for that program.\n\n(l) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting written correspondence demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Records responsive to a request shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced rate below the rate established under paragraph (d) of this section, where a component determines, based on all available information, that the requester has demonstrated that:\n\n(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and\n\n(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\n\n(2) Components shall furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the factors described in paragraphs (l)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are satisfied:\n\n(i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.\n\n(ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:\n\n(A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.\n\n(B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. Components shall presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.\n\n(iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the following criteria will be considered:\n\n(A) Identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.\n\n(B) If there is an identified commercial interest, a determination will be made whether the primary interest is furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (l)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. Ordinarily there will be a presumption, that when a news media requester has satisfied factors (l)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.\n\n(3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver must be granted for those records.\n\n(4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.",

Examples of adverse determinations are provided in § 102.6(e). The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 working days after the date of the response. The appeal should clearly identify the component's determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”\n\n(b) Adjudication of appeals. (1) The Chief, FOI/PA or designee will act on behalf of the SBA on all appeals under this section.\n\n(2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.\n\n(3) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the FOI/PA Office shall take appropriate action to ensure compliance with Executive Orders 13467 and 13526.\n\n(c) Decisions on appeals. A decision on an appeal will be made in writing. A decision that upholds a component's determination will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the mediation services offered by OGIS as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If a component's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the requester will be notified of that determination in writing. The component will thereafter, further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and respond directly to the requester.\n\n(d) Time limit for issuing appeal decision. The statutory time limit for responding to appeals is generally 20 working days after receipt. However, the Appeals Officer may extend the time limit for responding to an appeal provided the circumstances set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(i) are met.\n\n(e) Engaging in dispute resolution services provided by OGIS. Mediation is a voluntary process. If a component agrees to participate in the mediation services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.\n\n(f) When an appeal is required. Before seeking review by a court of a component's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.",

These regulations set forth the procedures by which individuals may request access to records about themselves, request amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures of those records by the SBA. These regulations also set forth the requirements applicable to SBA employees maintaining, collecting, using or disseminating records pertaining to individuals. This subpart applies to SBA and all of its offices and is mandatory for use by all SBA employees.\n\n(b) Definitions.

Each SBA office shall, in accordance with the Privacy Act:\n\n(1) Maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the Agency required to be accomplished by a statute or by Executive Order of the President;\n\n(2) Collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may affect an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs;\n\n(b) Requests for information from individuals. If a form is being used to collect information from individuals, either the form used to collect the information, or a separate form that can be retained by the individual, must state the following:\n\n(1) The authority (whether granted by statute, or by Executive Order of the President) which authorizes the solicitation of the information and whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary;\n\n(2) The principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used;\n\n(3) The routine uses which may be made of the information; and\n\n(4) The effects on such individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.\n\n(c) Report on new systems. Each SBA office shall provide adequate advance notice to Congress and OMB through the FOI/PA Office of any proposal to establish or alter any system of records in order to permit an evaluation of the probable or potential effect of such proposal on the privacy and other personal or property rights of individuals or the disclosure of information relating to such individuals.\n\n(d) Accurate and secure maintenance of records. Each SBA office shall:\n\n(1) Maintain all records which are used in making any determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination;\n\n(2) Prior to disseminating any record from a system of records about an individual to any requestor, including an agency, make reasonable efforts to assure that such records are accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for SBA purposes; and\n\n(3) Establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to insure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained.\n\n(i) PASMs, with the approval of the head of their offices, shall establish administrative and physical controls, consistent with SBA regulations, to insure the protection of records systems from unauthorized access or disclosure and from physical damage or destruction. The controls instituted shall be proportional to the degree of sensitivity of the records but at a minimum must ensure that records other than those available to the general public under the FOIA, are protected from public view, that the area in which the records are stored is supervised during all business hours and physically secured during non-business hours to prevent unauthorized personnel from obtaining access to the records.\n\n(ii) PASMs, with the approval of the head of their offices, shall adopt access restrictions to insure that only those individuals within the agency who have a need to have access to the records for the performance of their duties have access to them. Procedures shall also be adopted to prevent accidental access to, or dissemination of, records.\n\n(e) Prohibition against maintenance of records concerning First Amendment rights. No SBA office shall maintain a record describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment (e.g. speech), unless the maintenance of such record is:\n\n(1) Expressly authorized by statute, or\n\n(2) Expressly authorized by the individual about whom the record is maintained, or\n\n(3) Pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.",

A request received by the FOI/PA Office will be forwarded to the appropriate SBA Office where the records are located.\n\n(b) Description of records sought. A request for access to records must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable SBA personnel to locate the system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of effort. A request should also state the date of the record or time period in which the record was compiled, and the name or identifying number of each system of records in which the requester believes the record is kept. The SBA publishes notices in the Federal Register that describe its systems of records. A description of the SBA's systems of records also may be found at http://www.sba.gov/foia/systemrecords.doc.\n\n(c) Verification of identity. Any individual who submits a request for access to records must verify his or her identity. No specific form is required; however, the requester must state his or her full name, current address, and date and place of birth. The request must be signed and the requester's signature must either be notarized or submitted under 28 U.S.C. 1746. This law permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization, the language states:\n\n(1) If executed outside the United States: “I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). Signature”; or\n\n(2) If executed within the Untied States, its territories, possessions or commonwealths: “I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). Signature”.\n\n(d) Verification of guardianship. When making a request as a legal agent or the parent or guardian of a minor or as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent, for access to records about that individual, the requester must establish:\n\n(1) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the record, by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth, and, at the requester's option, the social security number of the individual;\n\n(2) The requester's own identity, as required in paragraph (c) of this section;\n\n(3) That the requester is the legal agent or parent or guardian of that individual, which may be proven by providing a copy of the individual's birth certificate showing his parentage or by providing a court order establishing guardianship; and\n\n(4) That the requester is acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.",

    "content": "(a) In general. Except as stated in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section and in § 102.24(a), the office that first receives a request for access to a record, and has possession of that record, is the office responsible for responding to the request. That office shall acknowledge receipt of the request not later than 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the date of receipt of the request in writing. In determining which records are responsive to a request, an office ordinarily shall include only those records in its possession as of the date the office begins its search for them. If any other date is used, the office shall inform the requester of that date.\n\n(b) Authority to grant or deny requests. The Program/Support Office Head, or designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for access to a record of that office.\n\n(c) Consultations and referrals. When an office receives a request for access to a record in its possession, it shall determine whether another office, or another agency of the Federal Government, is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from access under the Privacy Act. If the receiving office determines that it is best able to process the record in response to the request, then it shall do so. If the receiving office determines that it is not best able to process the record, then it shall either:\n\n(1) Respond to the request regarding that record, after consulting with the office or agency best able to determine whether the record is exempt from access and with any other office or agency that has a substantial interest in it; or\n\n(2) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request to the office best able to determine whether the record is exempt from access or to another agency that originated the record (but only if that agency is subject to the Privacy Act). Ordinarily the office or agency that originated a record will be presumed to be best able to determine whether it is exempt from access.\n\n(d) Law enforcement information. Whenever a request is made for access to a record containing information that relates to an investigation of a possible violation of law and that was originated by SBA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) or another agency, the receiving office shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to either SBA's OIG or the other agency “depending on where the investigation originated.”\n\n(e) Classified information. Whenever a request is made for access to a record containing information that has been classified by or may be appropriate for classification by another office or agency under Executive Order 12958 or any other executive order concerning the classification of records, the receiving office shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the office or agency that classified the information, should consider the information for classification, or has the primary interest in it, as appropriate. Whenever a record contains information that has been derivatively classified by an office because it contains information classified by another office or agency, the office shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the office or agency that classified the underlying information. Information determined to no longer require classification shall not be withheld from a requester on the basis of Exemption (k)(1) of the Privacy Act.\n\n(f) Notice of referral. Whenever an office refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another office or agency, it shall notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name of each office or agency to which the request has been referred and of the part of the request that has been referred.\n\n(g) Responses to consultations and referrals. All consultations and referrals shall be processed according to the date the access request was initially received by the first office or agency, not any later date.\n\n(h) Agreements regarding consultations and referrals. Offices may make agreements with other offices or agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.",

The Program/Support Office Head or designee shall inform the requester in the notice of any fee charged under § 102.31 and shall disclose records to the requester promptly on payment of any applicable fee. If a request is made in person, the office may disclose records to the requester directly, in a manner not unreasonably disruptive of its operations, on payment of any applicable fee and with a written record made of the grant of the request. If a requester is accompanied by another person, he or she shall be required to authorize in writing any discussion of the records in the presence of the other person.\n\n(c) Adverse determinations of requests for access. A Program/Support Office Head or designee making an adverse determination denying a request for access in any respect shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, consist of: a determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that the requested information is not a record subject to the Privacy Act; a determination on any disputed fee matter; and a denial of a request for expedited treatment. The notification letter shall be signed by the Program/Support Office Head or designee, and shall include:\n\n(1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;\n\n(2) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any FOIA or Privacy Act exemption(s) applied in denying the request; and\n\n(3) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 102.27(a) and a description of the requirements of § 102.27(a).",

The appeal must be received by the FOI/PA Office within 60 days of the date of the letter denying the request. The requester's appeal letter should include as much information as possible, including the identity of the office whose adverse determination is being appealed. Unless otherwise directed, the Chief, FOI/PA will decide all appeals under this subpart.\n\n(b) Responses to appeals. The decision on a requester's appeal will be made in writing not later than 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the date of receipt of such appeal. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in part will include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the affirmation, including any Privacy Act exemption applied, and will inform the requester of the Privacy Act provisions for court review of the decision. If the adverse determination is reversed or modified on appeal in whole or in part, the requester will be notified in a written decision and his request will be reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision.\n\n(c) Judicial review. In order to seek judicial review by a court of any adverse determination or denial of a request, a requester must first appeal it to the FOI/PA Office under this section.",

    "content": "(a) How made and addressed. Unless the record is not subject to amendment or correction as stated in paragraph (f) of this section, an individual may make a request for amendment or correction of an SBA record about himself or herself by writing directly to the office that maintains the record, following the procedures in § 102.24. The request should identify each particular record in question, state the amendment or correction sought, and state why the record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. The requester may submit any documentation that he or she thinks would be helpful. If the requester believes that the same record is in more than one system of records, that should be stated and the request should be sent to each office that maintains a system of records containing the record.\n\n(b) Office responses. Within ten (10) days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of receiving a request for amendment or correction of records, an office shall send the requester a written acknowledgment of receipt, and the office shall notify the requester within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of receipt of the request whether it is granted or denied. If the Program/Support Office Head or designee grants the request in whole or in part, the amendment or correction must be made, and the requester advised of his or her right to obtain a copy of the corrected or amended record. If the office denies a request in whole or in part, it shall send the requester a letter signed by the Program/Support Office Head or designee that shall state:\n\n(1) The reason(s) for the denial; and\n\n(2) The procedure for appeal of the denial under paragraph (c) of this section, including the name and business address of the official who will act on your appeal.\n\n(c) Appeals. An individual may appeal a denial of a request for amendment or correction to the FOI/PA Office in the same manner as a denial of a request for access to records (see § 102.27), and the same procedures shall be followed. If the appeal is denied, the requester shall be advised of his or her right to file a Statement of Disagreement as described in paragraph (d) of this section and of his or her right under the Privacy Act for court review of the decision.\n\n(d) Statement of Disagreement. If an appeal under this section is denied in whole or in part, the requester has the right to file a Statement of Disagreement that states the reason(s) for disagreeing with the SBA's denial of his or her request for amendment or correction. A Statement of Disagreement must be concise, must clearly identify each part of any record that is disputed, and should be no longer than one typed page for each fact disputed. An individual's Statement of Disagreement must be sent to the office that maintains the record involved, which shall place it in the system of records in which the disputed record is maintained and shall mark the disputed record to indicate that a Statement of Disagreement has been filed and where in the system of records it may be found.\n\n(e) Notification of amendment/correction or disagreement. Within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of the amendment or correction of a record, the office that maintains the record shall notify all persons, organizations, or agencies to which it previously disclosed the record, if an accounting of that disclosure was made, that the record has been amended or corrected. If an individual has filed a Statement of Disagreement, the office shall append a copy of it to the disputed record whenever the record is disclosed and may also append a concise statement of its reason(s) for denying the request to amend or correct the record.\n\n(f) Records not subject to amendment or correction. The following records are not subject to amendment or correction:\n\n(1) Transcripts of testimony given under oath or written statements made under oath;\n\n(2) Transcripts of grand jury proceedings, judicial proceedings, or quasi-judicial proceedings, which are the official record of those proceedings;\n\n(3) Pre-sentence records that originated with the courts; and\n\n(4) Records in systems of records that have been exempted from amendment and correction under Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) or (k) by notice published in the Federal Register.",

    "content": "The OCIO will enforce the computer matching provisions of the Privacy Act. The FOI/PA Office will review and concur on all computer matching agreements prior to their activation and/or renewal.\n\n(a) Matching agreements. SBA will comply with the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (5 U.S.C. 552a(o), 552a notes) . The Privacy Protection Act establishes procedures Federal agencies must use if they want to match their computer lists. SBA shall not disclose any record which is contained in a system of records to a recipient agency or non-Federal agency for use in a computer matching program except pursuant to a written agreement between SBA and the recipient agency or non-Federal agency specifying:\n\n(1) The purpose and legal authority for conducting the program;\n\n(2) The justification for the purpose and the anticipated results, including a specific estimate of any savings;\n\n(3) A description of the records that will be matched, including each data element that will be used, the approximate number of records that will be matched, and the projected starting and completion dates of the matching program;\n\n(4) Procedures for providing individualized notice at the time of application, and periodically thereafter as directed by the Data Integrity Board, that any information provided by any of the above may be subject to verification through matching programs to:\n\n(i) Applicants for and recipients of financial assistance or payments under Federal benefit programs, and\n\n(ii) Applicants for and holders of positions as Federal personnel.\n\n(5) Procedures for verifying information produced in such matching program as required by paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(6) Procedures for the retention and timely destruction of identifiable records created by a recipient agency or non-Federal agency in such matching program;\n\n(7) Procedures for ensuring the administrative, technical, and physical security of the records matched and the results of such programs;\n\n(8) Prohibitions on duplication and redisclosure of records provided by SBA within or outside the recipient agency or non-Federal agency, except where required by law or essential to the conduct of the matching program;\n\n(9) Procedures governing the use by a recipient agency or non-Federal agency of records provided in a matching program by SBA, including procedures governing return of the records to SBA or destruction of records used in such programs;\n\n(10) Information on assessments that have been made on the accuracy of the records that will be used in such matching programs; and\n\n(11) That the Comptroller General may have access to all records of a recipient agency or non-Federal agency that the Comptroller General deems necessary in order to monitor or verify compliance with the agreement.\n\n(b) Agreement specifications. A copy of each agreement entered into pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be transmitted to OMB, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Governmental Operations of the House of Representatives and be available upon request to the public.\n\n(1) No such agreement shall be effective until 30 days after the date on which a copy is transmitted.\n\n(2) Such an agreement shall remain in effect only for such period, not to exceed 18 months, as the Data Integrity Board determines is appropriate in light of the purposes, and length of time necessary for the conduct, of the matching program.\n\n(3) Within three (3) months prior to the expiration of such an agreement, the Data Integrity Board may without additional review, renew the matching agreement for a current, ongoing matching program for not more than one additional year if:\n\n(i) Such program will be conducted without any change; and\n\n(ii) Each party to the agreement certifies to the Board in writing that the program has been conducted in compliance with the agreement.\n\n(c) Verification. In order to protect any individual whose records are used in matching programs, SBA and any recipient agency or non-Federal agency may not suspend, terminate, reduce, or make a final denial of any financial assistance or payment under the Federal benefit program to such individual, or take other adverse action against such individual as a result of information produced by such matching programs until such information has been independently verified.\n\n(1) Independent verification requires independent investigation and confirmation of any information used as a basis for an adverse action against an individual including, where applicable:\n\n(i) The amount of the asset or income involved,\n\n(ii) Whether such individual actually has or had access to such asset or income or such individual's own use, and\n\n(iii) The period or periods when the individual actually had such asset or income.\n\n(2) SBA and any recipient agency or non-Federal agency may not suspend, terminate, reduce, or make a final denial of any financial assistance or payment under a Federal benefit program, or take other adverse action as a result of information produced by a matching program,\n\n(i) Unless such individual has received notice from such agency containing a statement of its findings and information of the opportunity to contest such findings, and\n\n(ii) Until the subsequent expiration of any notice period provided by the program's governing statute or regulations, or 30 days. Such opportunity to contest may be satisfied by notice, hearing, and appeal rights governing such Federal benefit program. The exercise of any such rights shall not affect rights available under the Privacy Act.\n\n(3) SBA may take any appropriate action otherwise prohibited by the above if SBA determines that the public health or safety may be adversely affected or significantly threatened during the notice period required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.\n\n(d) Sanctions. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, SBA may not disclose any record which is contained in a system of records to a recipient agency or non-Federal agency for a matching program if SBA has reason to believe that the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, or any matching agreement entered into pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or both, are not being met by such recipient agency.\n\n(1) SBA shall not renew a matching agreement unless,\n\n(i) The recipient agency or non-Federal agency has certified that it has complied with the provisions of that agreement; and\n\n(ii) SBA has no reason to believe that the certification is inaccurate.\n\n(e) Review annually each ongoing matching program in which the Agency has participated during the year, either as a source or as a matching agency in order to assure that the requirements of the Privacy Act, OMB guidance, and any Agency regulations and standard operating procedures, operating instructions, or guidelines have been met.\n\n(f) Data Integrity Board. SBA shall establish a Data Integrity Board (Board) to oversee and coordinate the implementation of the matching program. The Board shall consist of the senior officials designated by the Administrator, to include the Inspector General (who shall not serve as chairman), and the Senior Agency Official for Privacy. The Board shall:\n\n(1) Review, approve and maintain all written agreements for receipt or disclosure of Agency records for matching programs to ensure compliance with paragraph (a) of this section and with all relevant statutes, regulations, and guidance;\n\n(2) Review all matching programs in which SBA has participated during the year, determine compliance with applicable laws, regulations, guidelines, and Agency agreements, and assess the costs and benefits of such programs;\n\n(3) Review all recurring matching programs in which SBA has participated during the year, for continued justification for such disclosures;\n\n(4) At the instruction of OMB, compile a report to be submitted to the Administrator and OMB, and made available to the public on request, describing the matching activities of SBA, including,\n\n(i) Matching programs in which SBA has participated;\n\n(ii) Matching agreements proposed that were disapproved by the Board;\n\n(iii) Any changes in membership or structure of the Board in the preceding year;\n\n(iv) The reasons for any waiver of the requirement described below for completion and submission of a cost-benefit analysis prior to the approval of a matching program;\n\n(v) Any violations of matching agreements that have been alleged or identified and any corrective action taken; and\n\n(vi) Any other information required by OMB to be included in such report;\n\n(5) Serve as clearinghouse for receiving and providing information on the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of records used in matching programs;\n\n(6) Provide interpretation and guidance to SBA offices and personnel on the requirements for matching programs;\n\n(7) Review Agency recordkeeping and disposal policies and practices for matching programs to assure compliance with the Privacy Act; and\n\n(8) May review and report on any SBA matching activities that are not matching programs.\n\n(g) Cost-benefit analysis. Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, the Data Integrity Board shall not approve any written agreement for a matching program unless SBA has completed and submitted to such Board a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed program and such analysis demonstrates that the program is likely to be cost effective. The Board may waive these requirements if it determines, in writing, and in accordance with OMB guidelines, that a cost-benefit analysis is not required. Such an analysis also shall not be required prior to the initial approval of a written agreement for a matching program that is specifically required by statute.\n\n(h) Disapproval of matching agreements. If a matching agreement is disapproved by the Data Integrity Board, any party to such agreement may appeal to OMB. Timely notice of the filing of such an appeal shall be provided by OMB to the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives.\n\n(1) OMB may approve a matching agreement despite the disapproval of the Data Integrity Board if OMB determines that:\n\n(i) The matching program will be consistent with all applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements;\n\n(ii) There is adequate evidence that the matching agreement will be cost-effective; and\n\n(iii) The matching program is in the public interest.\n\n(2) The decision of OMB to approve a matching agreement shall not take effect until 30 days after it is reported to the committees described in paragraph (h) of this section.\n\n(3) If the Data Integrity Board and the OMB disapprove a matching program proposed by the Inspector General, the Inspector General may report the disapproval to the Administrator and to the Congress.",

In addition, compliance may be effected by any other means authorized by law.\n\n(2) Such other means may include but are not limited to (i) legal action by SBA to enforce its right, embodied in the assurances described in § 112.8, to accelerate the maturity of the recipient's obligation; (ii) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States, including other titles of the Act; and (iii) any applicable proceedings under State or local law.\n\n(b) Noncompliance with § 112.8. If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 112.8 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. SBA shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that SBA shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part. Such proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of part 134 of this chapter by an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, who shall issue an initial decision in the case. The Administrator shall be the reviewing official for purposes of § 134.228. The applicant's failure to file a timely motion in accordance with §§ 134.222 and 134.211, requesting that the matter be scheduled for an oral hearing, shall constitute waiver of the right to an oral hearing but shall not prevent the submission of written information and argument for the record in accordance with the provisions of part 134.\n\n(c) Conditions precedent. No order suspending, terminating, or refusing financial assistance shall become effective until (1) SBA has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; (2) there has been an express finding on the record after an opportunity for an oral hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part; (3) the initial decision has become final pursuant to § 134.227(b); and (4) the expiration of 30 days after SBA has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction of the form of financial assistance involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.\n\n(d) Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) SBA has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; (2) the action has been approved by the Administrator or his designee; (3) the applicant or recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and (4) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the applicant or recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the applicant or recipient or other person.

L. 94-239, 15 U.S.C. 1691, cited as the Equal Credit Act Amendments of 1976, it is unlawful for any recipient creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age: (Provided, the applicant has the capacity to contract), because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program, or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.\n\n(c) It is the intention of the Administrator that the prohibitions in this part supplement those in part 112 of this chapter, that the two parts be read in pari materia, and that the procedures established herein be harmonized to the maximum extent feasible with those established in part 112 of this chapter.",

In the case of a small business concern which receives financial assistance from a development company or from a small business investment company, such concern shall submit to the company such information as may be necessary to enable the company to meet its reporting requirements under this part.\n\n(c) Access to sources of information: Each applicant or recipient shall permit access by SBA during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part.

If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under § 113.5(b) to provide information as to the availability of equal opportunity, and the rights of individuals under this regulation, have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary for such applicant or recipient to take additional steps to make equal opportunity fully available to racial, qualified handicapped, nationality groups and persons who because of their sex were previously subjected to discrimination.\n\n(2) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory policies, the opportunities in the business it operates may not in fact be equally available to some racial, qualified handicapped, or nationality groups. In such circumstances a recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, religion, sex, marital status, qualified handicap or national origin to make the opportunities more widely available to such groups.",

A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by SBA.\n\n(c) Investigations. SBA will make a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this part. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the applicant or recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the applicant or recipient has failed to comply with this part.\n\n(d) Resolution of matters.

(1) If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by suspending, terminating, or refusing any financial assistance approved but not yet disbursed to an applicant. In the case of loans partially or fully disbursed, compliance with this part may be effected by calling, canceling, terminating, accelerating repayment, or suspending in whole or in part the financial assistance provided. In addition compliance may be effected by any other means authorized by law.\n\n(2) Such other means may include but are not limited to (i) legal action by SBA to enforce its rights, embodied in the assurances described in § 113.4; (ii) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States; and (iii) any applicable proceedings under State or local law.\n\n(b) Noncompliance with § 113.4. If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 113.4 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section, Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. SBA shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that SBA shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part. Such proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of part 134 of this chapter by an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, who shall issue an initial decision in the case. The Admininstrator shall be the reviewing official for purposes of § 134.228. The applicant's failure to file a timely motion in accordance with §§ 134.222 and 134.211, requesting that the matter be scheduled for an oral hearing, shall constitute waiver of the right to an oral hearing but shall not prevent the submission of written information and argument for the record in accordance with the provisions of part 134.\n\n(c) Condition precedent. Under this part 113, no order suspending, terminating, refusing, calling, canceling, or accelerating repayment of financial assistance in whole or in part shall become effective until (1) SBA has advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; (2) there has been an express finding on the record after an opportunity for an oral hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part; and (3) the initial decision has become final pursuant to § 134.227(b).\n\n(d) Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by any other means authorized by law shall be taken until:\n\n(1) SBA has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means.\n\n(2) The action has been approved by the Administrator or the Administrator's designee.\n\n(3) The applicant or recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance.\n\n(4) The expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the applicant or recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days, additional efforts shall be made to persuade the applicant or recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.\n\n[44 FR 20068, Apr. 4, 1979, as amended at 49 FR 33629, Aug. 24, 1984; 61 FR 2691, Jan. 29, 1996]",

    "content": "(a) Description of Surety Bond Guarantee Programs. SBA guarantees Sureties participating in the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs against a portion of their Losses incurred and paid as a result of a Principal's breach of the terms of a Bid Bond, Final Bond or Ancillary Bond, on any eligible Contract. In the Prior Approval Program, the Surety must obtain SBA's approval before a guaranteed bond can be issued. In the PSB Program, selected Sureties may issue, monitor, and service SBA guaranteed bonds without further SBA approval.\n\n(b) Eligibility of bonds. Bid Bonds and Final Bonds are eligible for an SBA guarantee if they are executed in connection with an eligible Contract, as defined in § 115.10, Definitions. Commercial and Fidelity bonds are not eligible for SBA guarantees. Ancillary Bonds may also be eligible for SBA's guarantee. A performance bond must not prohibit a Surety from performing the Contract upon default of the Principal.\n\n(c) Expiration of Bid Bond Guarantee. A Bid Bond guarantee expires 120 days after Execution of the Bid Bond, unless the Surety notifies SBA in writing before the 120th day that a later expiration date is required. The notification must include the new expiration date.\n\n(d) Guarantee agreement. The terms and conditions of SBA's bond guarantee agreements, including the guarantee percentage, may vary from Surety to Surety, depending on past experience with SBA. If the guarantee percentage is not fixed by the Investment Act, it is determined by OSG after considering, among other things, the rating or ranking assigned to the Surety by recognized authority, and the Surety's Loss rate, average Contract amount, average bond penalty per guaranteed bond, and ratio of Bid Bonds to Final Bonds, all in comparison with other Sureties participating in the same SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program (Prior Approval or PSB) to a comparable degree. Any guarantee agreement under this part is made exclusively for the benefit of SBA and the Surety, and does not confer any rights (such as a right of action against SBA) or benefits on any other party.\n\n(e) Amount of Contract—(1) Determination of Amount of Contract. For a fixed price Contract, the amount of the Contract is the price excluding any options. For a requirements Contract, the amount of the Contract is the price of the total estimated quantity to be ordered under the Contract. For an indefinite quantity Contract, the amount of the Contract is the price of the specified minimum quantity to be ordered under the Contract and, for each Order issued under such Contract, the price of each such Order. The amount of the Contract or Order to be bonded must not exceed the Applicable Statutory Limit as of the date:\n\n(i) SBA approves a Prior Approval Surety's request for a Bid Bond guarantee;\n\n(ii) A Preferred Surety Executes a Bid Bond; or\n\n(iii) The date Final Bonds (and any Ancillary Bonds) unrelated to an SBA-guaranteed Bid Bond are Executed by a Preferred Surety or by a Prior Approval Surety following SBA's approval of its request for a guarantee of Final Bonds.\n\n(2) Aggregation of Contract and Order amounts. (i) The amounts of two or more formally separate Contracts for a single construction project are aggregated to determine the Contract amount unless the Contracts are to be performed in phases and the prior bond is released before the beginning of each succeeding phase. A bond may be considered released even if the warranty period it is covering has not yet expired. For purposes of this paragraph, a “single construction project” means one represented by two or more Contracts of one Principal or its Affiliates with one Obligee or its Affiliates for performance at the same location, regardless of job title or nature of the work to be performed.\n\n(ii) The amounts of two or more Contracts or Orders for supplies and services awarded to the same Principal or its Affiliates are aggregated to determine the Contract or Order amount if SBA determines, after discussion with the contracting official responsible for the award of the contract, that award of a single Contract or Order could reasonably have satisfied the supply or service requirement at the time of issuance.\n\n(3) Federal Contracts or Orders in excess of $9,000,000 (as adjusted for inflation in accordance with section 1908 of title 41, United States Code). SBA is authorized to guarantee bonds on Federal Contracts or Orders greater than $9,000,000 (as adjusted for inflation in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1908), but not exceeding $14 million, upon a signed certification of a Federal contracting officer that the SBA guarantee is necessary. The certification must be either express mailed to SBA, Office of Surety Guarantees, 409 Third Street SW, Washington, DC 20416 or sent by email to suretybonds@sba.gov, and include the following additional information:\n\n(i) Name, address and telephone number of the small business;\n\n(ii) Offer or Contract number and brief description of the contract; and\n\n(iii) Estimated Contract value and date of anticipated award determination.\n\n(4) Alternative authority to guarantee bonds for Contracts and Orders related to a major disaster area. Subject to the availability of funds appropriated in advance specifically for the purpose of guaranteeing bonds for any Contract or Order related to a major disaster, SBA may, as an alternative to the authority otherwise set forth in this Part, guarantee bonds on any Contract or Order under the following terms and conditions:\n\n(i) The Contract or Order does not exceed $5,000,000 at the time of bond execution, and:\n\n(A) For products or services procured under a Federal Contract or Order, the products will be manufactured or the services will be performed in the major disaster area identified in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Web site at http://www.fema.gov, or the products will be manufactured or the services will be performed outside the major disaster area and the products or services will directly assist in the recovery efforts in the major disaster area; or\n\n(B) For products or services procured under any other Contract or Order, the products will be manufactured or the services will be performed in the major disaster area identified in the FEMA Web site at http://www.fema.gov;\n\n(ii) At the request of the Head of the Agency involved in reconstruction efforts in response to a major disaster, SBA may guarantee bonds on Federal Contracts or Orders in excess of $5,000,000, but not more than $10,000,000;\n\n(iii) A guarantee may be issued under this paragraph (e)(4) for any Contract or Order for which an offer is submitted or an award is made within 12 months from the date an area is designated a major disaster area in the Federal Register. SBA may, at its discretion, extend this time period for any particular disaster, and will publish a notice of the extension in the Federal Register.\n\n(f) Transfers or sales by Surety. Sureties must not sell or otherwise transfer their files or accounts, whether before or after a default by the Principal has occurred, without the prior written approval of SBA. A violation of this provision is grounds for termination from participation in the program. This provision does not apply to the sale of an entire business division, subsidiary or operation of the Surety.\n\n[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 66 FR 30804, June 8, 2001; 74 FR 36109, July 22, 2009; 76 FR 2572, Jan. 14, 2011; 79 FR 2086, Jan. 13, 2014; 87 FR 48083, Aug. 8, 2022; 89 FR 11712, Feb. 15, 2024]",

It must certify the percentage of work under the Contract to be subcontracted. SBA will not guarantee bonds for Principals who are primarily brokers. In addition, the Principal must retain full responsibility for the oversight and management of the Contract, including any work performed by any subcontractor, and may not subcontract the full scope of the statement of work.\n\n(6) Debarment. It must certify that the Principal is not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from transactions with any Federal department or agency, under governmentwide debarment and suspension rules.\n\n(7) No loss of eligibility.

In either case, the Loss includes interest (if any), but Loss is reduced by any amounts recovered (through offset or otherwise) by reason of the Principal's claims against laborers, materialmen, subcontractors, suppliers, or other rightful claimants, and by any amounts recovered from indemnitors and other salvage.\n\n(c) Loss under a Performance Bond is, at the Surety's option, the sum necessary to meet the cost of fulfilling the terms of a bonded Contract or the penal sum of the bond. In either case, the Loss includes interest (if any), but Loss is reduced by any amounts recovered (through offset or otherwise) by reason of the Principal's defenses or causes of action against the Obligee, and by any amounts recovered from indemnitors and other salvage.\n\n(d) Loss under an Ancillary Bond is the amount covered by such bond which is attributable to the Contract for which guaranteed Final Bonds were Executed.\n\n(e) Loss includes the following expenses if they are itemized, documented and attributable solely to the Loss under the guaranteed bond:\n\n(1) Amounts actually paid by the Surety for specialized services that are provided under contract by an outside consultant, which is not an Affiliate of the Surety, provided that such services are beyond the capability of the Surety's salaried claims staff, and amounts actually paid by the Surety for travel expenses of the Surety's claims staff. The cost of the consultant's services and the travel expenses of the Surety's claims staff must be reasonable and necessary and must specifically concern the investigation, adjustment, negotiation, compromise, settlement of, or resistance to a claim for Loss resulting from the breach of the terms of the bonded Contract. The cost allocation method must be reasonable and must comply with generally accepted accounting principles; and\n\n(2) Amounts actually paid by the Surety for court costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred to mitigate any Loss under paragraphs (a) through (e)(1) of this section including suits to obtain sums due from Obligees, indemnitors, Principals and others.\n\n(f) Loss does not include the following expenses:\n\n(1) Any unallocated expenses, all direct and indirect costs incurred by the Surety's salaried claims staff (except for reasonable and necessary travel expenses of such staff), or any clear mark-up on expenses or any overhead of the Surety, its attorney, or any other consultant hired by the Surety or the attorney;\n\n(2) Expenses paid for any suits, cross-claims, or counterclaims filed against the United States of America or any of its agencies, officers, or employees unless the Surety has received, prior to filing such suit or claim, written concurrence from SBA that the suit may be filed;\n\n(3) Attorney's fees and court costs incurred by the Surety in a suit by or against SBA or its Administrator;\n\n(4) Fees, costs, or other payments, including tort damages, arising from a successful tort suit or claim by a Principal or any other Person against the Surety; and\n\n(5) Any costs that arise from the Principal's failure to secure and maintain insurance coverage required by the Contract or Order, or any costs that result from any claims or judgments that exceed the amount of any insurance coverage required by the Contract or Order, as well as any costs that arise as a result of any agreement by the Principal in the Contract or Order to indemnify the Obligee or any other Persons.\n\n[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 76 FR 2572, Jan. 14, 2011; 81 FR 23566, Apr. 22, 2016]",

    "content": "(a) Indemnity agreements and collateral—(1) Requirements. The Surety must take all reasonable action to minimize risk of Loss including, but not limited to, obtaining from each Principal a written indemnity agreement which covers actual Losses under the Contract and Imminent Breach payments under § 115.34(a) or § 115.69. The indemnity agreement must be secured by such collateral as the Surety or SBA finds appropriate. Indemnity agreements from other Persons, secured or unsecured, may also be required by the Surety or SBA.\n\n(2) Prohibitions. No indemnity agreement may be obtained from the Surety, its agent or any other representative of the Surety. The Surety must not separately collateralize the portion of its bond which is not guaranteed by SBA.\n\n(b) Salvage and recovery—(1) General. The Surety must pursue all possible sources of salvage and recovery. Salvage and recovery includes all payments made in settlement of the Surety's claim, even though the Surety has incurred other losses as a result of that Principal which are not reimbursable by SBA.\n\n(2) SBA's share. SBA is entitled to its guaranteed percentage of all salvage and recovery from a defaulted Principal, its guarantors and indemnitors, and any other party, received by the Surety in connection with the guaranteed bond or any other bond issued by the Surety on behalf of the Principal unless such recovery is unquestionably identifiable as related solely to the non-guaranteed bond. The Surety must reimburse or credit SBA (in the same proportion as SBA's share of Loss) within 45 days of receipt of any recovery by the Surety.\n\n(3) Multiple Sureties. In any dispute between two or more Sureties concerning recovery under SBA guaranteed bonds, the dispute must first be brought to the attention of OSG for an attempt at mediation and settlement.\n\n[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 79 FR 2087, Jan. 13, 2014]",

    "content": "(a) Improper surety bond guarantee practices—(1) Imprudent practices. SBA may refuse to issue further guarantees to a Prior Approval Surety or may suspend the preferred status of a PSB Surety, by written notice stating all reasons for such decision and the effective date. Reasons for such a decision include, but are not limited to, a determination that the Surety (in its underwriting, its efforts to minimize Loss, its claims or recovery practices, or its documentation related to SBA guaranteed bonds) has failed to adhere to prudent standards or practices, including any standards or practices required by SBA, as compared to those of other Sureties participating in the same SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program to a comparable degree.\n\n(2) Regulatory violations, fraud. Acts of wrongdoing such as fraud, material misrepresentation, breach of the Prior Approval or PSB Agreement, the Surety's failure to continue to comply with the requirements set forth in § 115.11, or regulatory violations (as defined in § 115.19(d) and (h)) also constitute sufficient grounds for refusal to issue further guarantees, or in the case of a PSB Surety, termination of preferred status.\n\n(3) Audit; records. The failure of a Surety to consent to SBA's audit or to maintain and produce records constitutes grounds for SBA to refuse to issue further guarantees for a Prior Approval Surety, to suspend a PSB Surety from participation, and to refuse to honor claims submitted by a Prior Approval or PSB Surety until the Surety consents to the audit.\n\n(4) Excessive Losses. If a Surety experiences excessive Losses on SBA guaranteed bonds relative to those of other Sureties participating in the same SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program to a comparable degree, SBA may also require the renegotiation of the guarantee percentage and/or SBA's charge to the Surety for bonds executed thereafter.\n\n(b) Lack of business integrity. A Surety's participation in the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs may be denied, suspended, or terminated upon the occurrence of any event in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section involving any of the following Persons: The Surety or any of its officers, directors, partners, or other individuals holding at least 20% of the Surety's voting securities, and any agents, underwriters, or any individual empowered to act on behalf of any of the preceding Persons.\n\n(1) If a State or other authority has revoked, canceled, or suspended the license required of such Person to engage in the surety business, the right of such Person to participate in the SBA Surety Bond Guarantee Program may be denied, terminated, or suspended, as applicable, in that jurisdiction or in other jurisdictions. Ineligibility or suspension from the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs is for at least the duration of the license suspension.\n\n(2) If such Person has been indicted or otherwise formally charged with a misdemeanor or felony bearing on such Person's fitness to participate in the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs, the participation of such Person may be suspended pending disposition of the charge. Upon conviction, participation may be denied or terminated.\n\n(3) If a final civil judgment is entered holding that such Person has committed a breach of trust or violation of a law or regulation protecting the integrity of business transactions or relationships, participation may be denied or terminated.\n\n(4) If such Person has made a material misrepresentation or willfully false statement in the presentation of oral or written information to SBA in connection with an application for a surety bond guarantee or the presentation of a claim, or committed a material breach of the Prior Approval or PSB Agreement or a material violation of the regulations (all as described in § 115.19), participation may be denied or terminated.\n\n(5) If such Person is debarred, suspended, voluntarily excluded from, or declared ineligible for participation in Federal programs, participation may be denied or terminated.\n\n(c) Notification requirement. The Prior Approval or PSB Surety must promptly notify SBA of the occurrence of any event in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section, or if any of the Persons described in paragraph (b) of this section does not, or ceases to, qualify as a Surety. SBA may require submission of a Statement of Personal History (SBA Form 912) from any of these Persons.\n\n(d) SBA proceedings. Decisions to suspend, terminate, deny participation in, or deny reinstatement in the Surety Bond Guarantee program are made by the D/SG. A Surety may file a petition for review of suspensions and terminations with the SBA Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) under part 134 of this chapter. SBA's Administrator may, pending a decision pursuant to part 134 of this chapter, suspend the participation of any Surety for any of the causes listed in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this section.\n\n(e) Effect on guarantee. A guarantee issued by SBA before a suspension or termination under this section remains in effect, subject to SBA's right to deny liability under the guarantee.\n\n[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 81 FR 23566, Apr. 22, 2016]",

The total Contract or Order amount at the time of Execution of the bond exceeds the Applicable Statutory Limit (see § 115.10) or the bond amount at any time exceeds the total Contract or Order amount.\n\n(b) Misrepresentation or fraud. The Surety obtained the Prior Approval or PSB Agreement, or applied for reimbursement for losses, by fraud or material misrepresentation. Material misrepresentation includes (but is not limited to) both the making of an untrue statement of material fact and the omission of a statement of material fact necessary to make a statement not misleading in light of the circumstances in which it was made. Material misrepresentation also includes the adoption by the Surety of a material misstatement made by others which the Surety knew or under generally accepted underwriting standards should have known to be false or misleading. The Surety's failure to disclose its ownership (or the ownership by any owner of at least 20% of the Surety's equity) of an interest in a Principal or an Obligee is considered the omission of a statement of material fact.\n\n(c) Material breach. The Surety has committed a material breach of one or more terms or conditions of its Prior Approval or PSB Agreement. A material breach is considered to have occurred if:\n\n(1) Such breach (or such breaches in the aggregate) causes an increase in the Contract amount or in the bond amount of at least 25% or $500,000 of the original contract or bond amount, whichever is less; or\n\n(2) One of the conditions under Part B of Title IV of the Investment Act is not met.\n\n(d) Substantial regulatory violation. The Surety has committed a “substantial violation” of SBA regulations. For purposes of this paragraph, a “substantial violation” is a violation which causes an increase in the bond amount of at least 25% or $500,000 of the original contract or bond amount, whichever is less in the aggregate, or is contrary to the purposes of the Surety Bond Guarantee Programs.\n\n(e) Alteration. Without obtaining prior written approval from SBA (which may be conditioned upon payment of additional fees), the Surety agrees to or acquiesces in any material alteration in the terms, conditions, or provisions of the bond, including but not limited to the following acts:\n\n(1) Naming as an Obligee or co-Obligee any Person that does not qualify as an Obligee under § 115.10; or\n\n(2) In the case of a Prior Approval Surety, acquiescing in any alteration to the bond which would increase the bond amount by at least 25% or $500,000 of the original contract or bond amount, whichever is less.\n\n(f) Timeliness. (1) Either:\n\n(i) The bond was Executed prior to the date of SBA's guarantee; or\n\n(ii) The bond was Executed (or approved, if the Surety is legally bound by such approval) after the work under the Contract had begun, unless SBA executes a “Surety Bond Guarantee Agreement Addendum” (SBA Form 991) after receiving all of the following from the Surety:\n\n(A) Satisfactory evidence, including a certified copy of the Contract (or a sworn affidavit from the Principal), showing that the bond requirement was contained in the original Contract, or other documentation satisfactory to SBA, showing why a bond was not previously obtained and is now being required;\n\n(B) Certification by the Principal that all taxes and labor costs are current, and listing all suppliers and subcontractors, indicating that they are all paid to date, and attaching a waiver of lien from each; or an explanation satisfactory to SBA why such documentation cannot be produced; and\n\n(C) Certification by the Obligee that all payments due under the Contract to date have been made and that the job has been satisfactorily completed to date.\n\n(2)(i) For purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, work under a Contract is considered to have begun when a Principal takes any action related to the contract or bond that would have exposed its Surety to liability under applicable law had a bond been Executed (or approved, if the Surety is legally bound by such approval) at the time.\n\n(ii) For purposes of this paragraph (f), the Surety must maintain a contemporaneous record of the Execution and approval of each bond.\n\n(g) Delinquent fees. The Surety has not remitted to SBA the Principal's payment for the full amount of the guarantee fee within the time period required under § 115.30(d) for Prior Approval Sureties or § 115.66 for PSB Sureties, or has not made timely payment of the Surety's fee within the time period required by § 115.32(c). SBA may reinstate the guarantee upon showing that the contract is not in default and that a valid reason exists why a timely remittance or payment was not made.\n\n(h) Other regulatory violations. The occurrence of any of the following:\n\n(1) The Principal on the bonded Contract is not a small business;\n\n(2) The bond was not required under the bid solicitation or the original Contract;\n\n(3) The bond was not eligible for guarantee by SBA because the bonded contract was not a Contract as defined in § 115.10;\n\n(4) The loss occurred under a bond that was not guaranteed by SBA;\n\n(5) The loss incurred by the Surety was not a Loss as determined under § 115.16; or\n\n(6) The Surety's loss under a Performance Bond did not result from the Principal's breach or Imminent Breach of the Contract.\n\n[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 66 FR 30804, June 8, 2001; 72 FR 34599, July 25, 2007; 74 FR 36110, July 22, 2009; 79 FR 2087, Jan. 13, 2014; 82 FR 39501, Aug. 21, 2017; 87 FR 48084, Aug. 8, 2022]",

See paragraph (d) of this section for additional requirements when the Contract or bond amount changes.\n\n(d) Contract or bond increases/decreases—(1) Notification and approval. The Prior Approval Surety must notify SBA of any increases or decreases in the Contract or bond amount that aggregate 25% or $500,000 of the original contract or bond amount, whichever is less, as soon as the Surety acquires knowledge of the change. Whenever the original bond amount increases as a result of a single change order of at least 25% or $500,000 of the original contract or bond amount, whichever is less, the prior written approval of such increase by SBA is required on a supplemental Prior Approval Agreement and is conditioned upon payment by the Surety of the increase in the Principal's guarantee fee as set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. In notifying SBA of any increase or decrease in the Contract or bond amount, the Prior Approval Surety must use SBA Form 990 and select the application type that it used in applying for the original bond guarantee.\n\n(2) Increases; fees. The payment for the increase in the Principal's guarantee fee, which is computed on the increase in the Contract amount, is due upon notification of the increase in the Contract or bond amount under this paragraph (d). If the increase in the Principal's fee is less than $250, no payment is due until the total amount of increases in the Principal's fee equals or exceeds $250. The Surety's payment of the increase in the Surety's guarantee fee, computed on the increase in the bond Premium, must be submitted to SBA within 60 calendar days of SBA's approval of the Prior Approval Agreement, unless the amount of such increased guarantee fee is less than $250. When the total amount of increase in the guarantee fee equals or exceeds $250, the Surety must remit the fee within 60 calendar days.\n\n(3) Decreases; refunds. Whenever SBA is notified of a decrease in the Contract or bond amount, SBA will refund to the Principal a proportionate amount of the Principal's guarantee fee and rebate to the Surety a proportionate amount of SBA's Premium share in the ordinary course of business. If the amount to be refunded or rebated is less than $250, such refund or rebate will not be made until the amounts to be refunded or rebated, respectively, aggregate at least $250. Upon receipt of the refund, the Surety must promptly pay a proportionate amount of its Premium to the Principal.\n\n[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 72 FR 34599, June 25, 2007; 77 FR 41665, July 16, 2012; 79 FR 2087, Jan. 13, 2014; 82 FR 39502, Aug. 21, 2017; 87 FR 48084, Aug. 8, 2022; 88 FR 24473, Apr. 21, 2023]",

    "content": "A surety bonding line is a written commitment by SBA to a Prior Approval Surety which provides for the Surety's Execution of multiple bonds for a specified small business strictly within pre-approved terms, conditions and limitations. In applying for a bonding line, the Surety must provide SBA with information on the applicant as requested. In addition to the other limitations and provisions set forth in this part 115, the following conditions apply to each surety bonding line:\n\n(a) Underwriting. A bonding line may be issued by SBA for a Principal only if the underwriting evaluation is satisfactory. The Prior Approval Surety must require the Principal to keep it informed of all its contracts, whether bonded by the same or another surety or unbonded, during the term of the bonding line.\n\n(b) Bonding line conditions. The bonding line contains limitations on the following:\n\n(1) The term of the bonding line, not to exceed 1 year subject to renewal in writing;\n\n(2) The total dollar amount of the Principal's bonded and unbonded work on hand at any time, including outstanding bids, during the term of the bonding line;\n\n(3) The number of such bonded and unbonded contracts outstanding at any time during the term of the bonding line;\n\n(4) The maximum dollar amount of any single guaranteed bonded Contract;\n\n(5) The timing of Execution of bonds under the bonding line—bonds must be dated and Executed before the work on the underlying Contract has begun, or the Surety must submit to SBA the documentation required under § 115.19(f)(1)(ii); and\n\n(6) Any other limitation related to type, specialty of work, geographical area, or credit.\n\n(c) Excess bonding. If, after a bonding line is issued, the Principal desires a bond and the Surety desires a guarantee exceeding a limitation of the bonding line, the Surety must submit an application to SBA under regular procedures.\n\n(d) Submission of forms to SBA—(1) Bid Bonds. Within 15 business days after the Execution of any Bid Bonds under a bonding line, the Surety must submit a “Surety Bond Guarantee Agreement (Form 990)” to SBA for approval. If the Surety fails to submit the form within this time period, SBA's guarantee of the bond will be void from its inception unless SBA determines otherwise upon a showing that a valid reason exists why the timely submission was not made.\n\n(2) Final Bonds. Within 15 business days after the Execution of any Final Bonds under a bonding line, the Surety must submit a Surety Bond Guarantee Agreement (SBA Form 990) to SBA for approval. If the surety fails to submit this form within the time period or the guarantee fees are not paid in accordance with § 115.32, SBA's guarantee of the bond will be void from its inception unless SBA determines otherwise upon a showing that the Contract is not in default and a valid reason exists why the timely submission was not made.\n\n(3) Additional information. The Surety must submit any other data SBA requests.\n\n(e) Cancellation of bonding line—(1) Optional cancellation. Either SBA or the Surety may cancel a bonding line at any time, with or without cause, upon written notice to the other party. Upon the receipt of any adverse information concerning the Principal, the Surety must promptly notify SBA, and SBA may cancel the bonding line.\n\n(2) Mandatory cancellation. Upon the occurrence of a default by the Principal, whether under a contract bonded by the same or another surety or an unbonded contract, the Surety must immediately cancel the bonding line.\n\n(3) Effect of cancellation. Cancellation of a bonding line by SBA is effective upon receipt of written notice by the Surety. Bonds issued before the effective date of cancellation remain guaranteed by SBA. Upon cancellation by SBA or the Surety, the Surety must promptly notify the Principal in writing.\n\n[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 77 FR 41665, July 16, 2012; 87 FR 48084, Aug. 8, 2022]",

OSG's prior approval will be given only if the Surety demonstrates to SBA's satisfaction that a breach is imminent and that there is no other recourse to prevent such breach.\n\n(2) Amount of reimbursement. The aggregate of the payments by SBA to avoid Imminent Breach cannot exceed 10% of the Contract amount, unless the Administrator finds that a greater payment (not to exceed the guaranteed share of the bond penalty) is necessary and reasonable. In no event will SBA make any duplicate payment pursuant to this or any other provision of this part 115.\n\n(3) Recordkeeping requirement. The Surety must keep records of payments made to avoid Imminent Breach.\n\n(b) Salvage and recovery. A Prior Approval Surety must pursue all possible sources of salvage and recovery until SBA concurs with the Surety's recommendation for a discontinuance or for a settlement. The Surety must certify that continued pursuit of salvage and recovery would be neither economically feasible nor a viable strategy in maximizing recovery. See also § 115.17(b).",

Notification must be made in writing at the earlier of the time the Surety applies for a guarantee on behalf of an affected Principal, or within 30 days of the date the Surety acquires knowledge, or should have acquired knowledge, of any of the listed events.\n\n(b) Surety action. The Surety must take all necessary steps to mitigate Losses resulting from any of the events in paragraph (a) of this section, including the disposal at fair market value of any collateral held by or available to the Surety. Unless SBA notifies the Surety otherwise, the Surety must take charge of all claims or suits arising from a defaulted bond, and compromise, settle and defend such suits. The Surety must handle and process all claims under the bond and all settlements and recoveries as it does on non-guaranteed bonds.\n\n(c) Claim reimbursement requests. (1) Claims for reimbursement for Losses which the Surety has paid must be submitted (together with a copy of the bond, the bonded Contract, and any indemnity agreements) with the initial claim to OSG on a “Default Report, Claim for Reimbursement and Report of Recoveries” (SBA Form 994H), within 90 days from the time of each disbursement. Claims submitted after 90 days must be accompanied by substantiation satisfactory to SBA. The date of the claim for reimbursement is the date of receipt of the claim by SBA, or such later date as additional information requested by SBA is received.\n\n(2) The Surety must also submit evidence of the disposal of all collateral at fair market value.\n\n(3) SBA may request additional information prior to reimbursing the Surety for its Loss.\n\n(4) Subject to the offset provisions of part 140, SBA pays its share of the Loss incurred and paid by the Surety within 45 days of receipt of the requisite information.\n\n(5) Claims for reimbursement and any additional information submitted are subject to review and audit by SBA, including but not limited to the Surety's compliance with SBA's regulations and forms.\n\n(d) Status updates. The Surety must submit semiannual status reports on each claim 6 months after the initial default notice, and then every 6 months. The Surety must notify SBA immediately of any substantial changes in the status of the claim or the amounts of Loss reserves.\n\n(e) Reservation of SBA rights. The payment by SBA of a Surety's claim does not waive or invalidate any of the terms of the Prior Approval Agreement, the regulations set forth in this part 115, or any defense SBA may have against the Surety. Within 30 days of receipt of notification that a claim or any portion of a claim should not have been paid by SBA, the Surety must repay the specified amounts to SBA.\n\n[61 FR 3271, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 79 FR 2087, Jan. 13, 2014]",

No SBA guarantee attaches to bonds approved before the D/SG or designee has countersigned the Agreement.

No SBA guarantee attaches to bonds approved by a PSB Surety if the bonds exceed the allotted authority for the period in which the bonds are approved. No reliance on future authority is permitted. An allotment can be increased only by prior written permission of SBA.\n\n(b) Execution of Bid Bonds. When the PSB Surety Executes a Bid Bond, SBA debits the Surety's allotment for an amount equal to the guarantee percentage of the estimated penal sum of the Final Bond SBA would guarantee if the Contract were awarded. If the Contract is then awarded for an amount other than the bid amount, or if the bid is withdrawn or the Bid Bond guarantee has expired (see § 115.12(c)), SBA debits or credits the Surety's allotment accordingly.\n\n(c) Execution of Final Bonds. If the PSB Surety Executes a guaranteed Final Bond, but not the related Bid Bond, SBA debits the Surety's allotment for an amount equal to the guarantee percentage of the penal sum of the Final Bond. SBA will debit the allotment for increases, and credit the allotment for decreases, in the bond amount.\n\n(d) Release and non-issuance of Final Bonds. The release of Final Bonds upon completion of the Contract does not restore the corresponding allotment. If, however, a PSB Surety approves a Final Bond but never issues the bond, SBA will credit the Surety's allotment for an amount equal to the guarantee percentage of the penal sum of the bond. In that event, the Surety must notify SBA as soon as possible, but in no event later than 5 business days after the non-issuance has been determined.

Hearings shall be held before an administrative law judge designated in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n(c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and SBA shall have the right to be represented by counsel.\n\n(d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearings, decisions, and any administrative review shall be conducted in conformity with the Administrative Procedure Act and 13 CFR part 134. Such rules of procedure should be consistent with this section, relate to the conduct of the hearing, provide for giving of notices to those referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments, and briefs, request for findings and other related matters. SBA, the complainant, if any, and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing, or as determined by the administrative law judge conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.\n\n(2) Technical rules of evidence may be waived by the administrative law judge conducting a hearing pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available, and subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary. The administrative law judge may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.\n\n(e) Consolidated or joint hearings. In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance or threatened noncompliance with this part, with respect to two or more forms of financial assistance to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal agencies issued under the Act, the Administrator may, by agreement with such other agencies, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules and procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 117.17.",

    "content": "(a) Decision by an administrative law judge. If the hearing is held by an administrative law judge, such administrative law judge shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record, including recommended findings and proposed decision, to the Administrator for a final decision and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient and the complainant. Where the initial decision is made by the administrative law judge, the applicant or recipient may, within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision, file with the Administrator exceptions to the initial decision, with the reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the Administrator may, by motion within 45 days after the initial decision, serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that he/she will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review, the Administrator shall review the initial decision and issue his/her decision thereon, including the reasons therefor.

The Administrator shall make any final decision which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, acceleration repayment or the imposition of any other sanction available under the regulations or taken under other means authorized by law.\n\n(f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for accelerating of repayment, suspension or termination of, or refusal to approve, disburse, or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will, thereafter, be extended to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to have failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the Administrator that it will fully comply with this part.\n\n(g) Post termination proceedings. (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (e) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance only if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility and it brings itself into compliance with this regulation and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this regulation.\n\n(2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the Administrator to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the Administrator determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he/she shall restore such eligibility.\n\n(3) If the Administrator denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes the denial to have been in error. It shall there upon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules and procedures issued by the Administrator. The applicant or recipient shall be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.",

    "content": "(a) SBA offers low interest, fixed rate loans to disaster survivors, enabling them to repair or replace property damaged or destroyed in declared disasters. It also offers such loans to affected small businesses to help them recover from economic injury caused by such disasters. SBA also offers interim guaranteed disaster loans, in participation with financial institutions, to affected small businesses (“IDAP loans”).\n\n(b) Disaster declarations are official notices recognizing that specific geographic areas have been damaged by floods and other acts of nature, riots, civil disorders, or industrial accidents such as oil spills. These disasters are sudden events which cause severe physical damage, and do not include slower physical occurrences such as shoreline erosion or gradual land settling. However, for purposes of economic injury disaster loans only, they do include droughts and below average water levels in the Great Lakes or on any body of water in the United States that supports commerce by small businesses. Sudden events that cause substantial economic injury may be disasters even if they do not cause physical damage to a survivor's property. Past examples include ocean conditions causing significant displacement (major ocean currents) or closure (toxic algae blooms) of customary fishing waters, as well as contamination of food or other products for human consumption from unforeseeable and unintended events beyond the control of the survivors.\n\n[89 FR 91538, Nov. 20, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) There are seven ways in which disaster declarations are issued which make SBA disaster loans possible:\n\n(1) The President declares a Major Disaster and authorizes Federal Assistance, including individual assistance (Assistance to Individuals and Households Program).\n\n(2) If the President declares a Major Disaster limited to public assistance only, a private nonprofit facility which provides non-critical services under guidelines of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must first apply to SBA for disaster loan assistance for such non-critical services before it could seek grant assistance from FEMA.\n\n(3) SBA makes a physical disaster declaration, based on the occurrence of at least a minimum amount of physical damage to buildings, machinery, equipment, inventory, homes and other property. Such damage usually must meet the following tests:\n\n(i) In any county or other smaller political subdivision of a State or U.S. territory, at least 25 homes or 25 businesses, or a combination of at least 25 homes, businesses, or other eligible institutions, each sustain uninsured losses of 40 percent or more of the estimated fair replacement value or pre-disaster fair market value of the damaged property, whichever is lower; or\n\n(ii) In any such political subdivision, at least three businesses each sustain uninsured losses of 40 percent or more of the estimated fair replacement value or pre-disaster fair market value of the damaged property, whichever is lower, and, as a direct result of such physical damage, 25 percent or more of the work force in their community would be unemployed for at least 90 days; and\n\n(iii) The Governor of the State or the Chief Executive of the Indian Tribal government in which the disaster occurred submits a written request to SBA for a physical disaster declaration by SBA. This request should be delivered to the Disaster Assistance Field Operations Center serving the jurisdiction within 60 days of the date of the disaster.\n\n(4) SBA makes an economic injury disaster declaration in response to a determination of a natural disaster by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n\n(5) SBA makes an economic injury declaration in reliance on a state certification that at least five small business concerns in a disaster area have suffered substantial economic injury as a result of the disaster and are in need of financial assistance not otherwise available on reasonable terms. The state certification must be signed by the Governor, must specify the county or counties or other political subdivision in which the disaster occurred, and should be delivered (with supporting documentation) to the Disaster Assistance Field Operations Center serving the jurisdiction within 120 days of the disaster occurrence. When a Governor certifies with respect to a drought or to below average water levels, the supporting documentation must include findings which show that conditions during the incident period meet or exceed the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) standard of “severe” (Intensity level D-2 to D-4). The USDM may be found at https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/. With respect to below average water levels, the supplementary information accompanying the certification must include findings which establish long-term average water levels based on recorded historical data, show that current water levels are below long-term average levels, and demonstrate that economic injury has occurred as a direct result of the low water levels. Not later than 30 days after SBA receives a certification by a Governor, it shall respond in writing with its decision and its reasons.\n\n(6) SBA makes a physical disaster declaration in a rural area (rural disaster declaration) upon request from the Governor of the State or the Chief Executive of the Indian Tribal government in which the rural area is located. Rural area means any county or other political subdivision of a State, the District of Columbia, or a territory of the United States that is designated as a rural area by the Bureau of the Census. The following conditions must be met:\n\n(i) The President has declared a Major Disaster for the rural area, but has not authorized individual assistance; and\n\n(ii) Any home, small business concern, private nonprofit organization, or small agricultural cooperative in the rural area has incurred significant damage. Significant damage means uninsured losses of 40 percent or more of the estimated fair replacement value or pre-disaster fair market value of the damaged property, whichever is lower.\n\n(7) SBA makes an economic injury disaster declaration in response to a determination of an emergency involving Federal primary responsibility by the President.\n\n(b) SBA publishes notice of any disaster declaration in the Federal Register. The published notice will identify the kinds of assistance available, the date and nature of the disaster, and the deadline and location for filing loan applications. Additionally, SBA will use the local media to inform potential loan applicants where to obtain loan applications and otherwise to assist disaster survivors in applying for disaster loans. SBA will accept applications after the announced deadline only when SBA determines that the late filing resulted from substantial causes beyond the control of the applicant.\n\n[61 FR 3304, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 13667, Mar. 22, 1999; 67 FR 64518, Oct. 21, 2002; 71 FR 63676, Oct. 31, 2006; 71 FR 75409, Dec. 15, 2006; 73 FR 54675, Sept. 23, 2008; 81 FR 67903, Oct. 3, 2016; 88 FR 24109, Apr. 19, 2023; 89 FR 91538, Nov. 20, 2024]",

(1) If the amount of an IDAP Borrower's disaster losses is $25,000 or less, the principal amount of an IDAP loan must not exceed the amount of disaster losses minus Other Recoveries.\n\n(2) If the amount of an IDAP Borrower's disaster losses is more than $25,000, the principal amount of an IDAP loan must not exceed $25,000 minus Other Recoveries.\n\n(c) Disbursement. The disbursement period for an IDAP loan is generally up to 30 days from the date of SBA approval of the IDAP loan. If the IDAP Lender is notified before disbursement of the IDAP loan that the IDAP Borrower has received Other Recoveries, the IDAP Lender must decrease the approved amount of the IDAP loan by the amount of the Other Recoveries. If the IDAP Borrower's Disaster Loan is approved, SBA will contact the IDAP Lender when SBA is ready to disburse the Disaster Loan. Upon receipt of such notification by SBA, the IDAP Lender must cancel any remaining undisbursed amount of the IDAP loan.\n\n(d) Repayment—(1) Initial Period. During the Initial Period, an IDAP Borrower will pay interest only on the disbursed principal balance of the IDAP loan. If SBA approves the IDAP Borrower's Disaster Loan application, SBA will require that the IDAP loan be repaid first from the proceeds of the Disaster Loan. If the IDAP Borrower receives Other Recoveries during the Initial Period, the IDAP Borrower must, in accordance with § 123.703(h), remit the Other Recoveries to the IDAP Lender, and the IDAP Lender will apply the Other Recoveries to the IDAP loan. If the IDAP Borrower's Disaster Loan application is declined or if the amount of the approved Disaster Loan is insufficient to repay the IDAP loan in full, the remaining balance of the IDAP loan will be repaid during the Term Period as described in paragraph (2). The Initial Period ends upon (i) full repayment of the IDAP loan from the proceeds of the IDAP Borrower's Disaster Loan; (ii) SBA notice to the IDAP Lender of decline of the IDAP Borrower's Disaster Loan Application; or (iii) receipt by the IDAP Lender of partial repayment of the IDAP loan from the proceeds of the Disaster Loan; provided that if the IDAP loan has not been fully disbursed at such time, the Initial Period shall not end until the IDAP loan is fully disbursed. If an IDAP Borrower withdraws an application for a Disaster Loan, fails to close on an approved Disaster Loan or if the approved Disaster Loan is cancelled, the IDAP loan is immediately due and payable by the IDAP Borrower.\n\n(2) Term Period. If SBA declines the IDAP Borrower's Disaster Loan application or the approved amount of the Disaster Loan is insufficient to repay the IDAP loan in full, the IDAP Borrower must pay principal and interest on the IDAP loan, with the IDAP loan balance to be fully amortized over a period that is at least 10 years from the date of final disbursement of the IDAP loan, but no more than 25 years from the date of final disbursement. The Term Period begins in the first month following SBA notice to the IDAP Lender of decline of the IDAP Borrower's Disaster Loan application, receipt by the IDAP Lender of partial repayment of the IDAP loan from the proceeds of the Disaster Loan, or final disbursement of the IDAP loan, whichever is later. Balloon payments are not permitted. The IDAP Borrower may prepay all or a portion of the principal during the life of the loan without penalty. If the IDAP Borrower receives Other Recoveries during the Term Period, the IDAP Borrower must, in accordance with § 123.703(h), remit the Other Recoveries to the IDAP Lender, and the IDAP Lender will apply the Other Recoveries to the IDAP loan.\n\n(e) Interest rate—(1) Initial Period. The maximum interest rate an IDAP Lender may charge an IDAP Borrower during the Initial Period will be published by SBA in the Federal Register from time to time. This rate must be a fixed rate.\n\n(2) Term Period. The maximum interest rate an IDAP Lender may charge an IDAP Borrower during the Term Period will be published in the Federal Register from time to time. The IDAP Lender may charge either a fixed or a variable rate during the Term Period.\n\n(f) Number of IDAP loans per small business. No small business (including affiliates) may obtain more than one IDAP loan per Declared Disaster. The provisions of § 120.151 do not apply to IDAP loans.\n\n(g) Personal guarantees. Holders of at least a 20 percent ownership interest in the IDAP Borrower must guarantee the IDAP loan.\n\n(h) Agreement to remit Other Recoveries. IDAP Borrowers must promptly notify the IDAP Lender of the receipt of Other Recoveries, and must promptly remit the proceeds of Other Recoveries to the IDAP Lender. The IDAP Lender must apply the Other Recoveries to the IDAP loan balance. SBA does not require any additional collateral for IDAP loans.",

    "content": "(a) IDAP Lenders. An IDAP Lender must be a 7(a) Lender (as defined in § 120.10). Notwithstanding the provisions of § 120.470(a), a Small Business Lending Company (SBLC) that is a 7(a) Lender may make IDAP loans. An IDAP Lender must sign a supplemental Loan Guarantee Agreement for the IDAP loan program. An IDAP Lender must comply and maintain familiarity with the IDAP Loan Program Requirements, as such requirements are revised from time to time. IDAP Loan Program Requirements in effect at the time that an IDAP Lender takes an action in connection with a particular IDAP loan govern that specific action. With respect to their activities in the IDAP loan program, IDAP Lenders are subject to the requirements of §§ 120.140 (What ethical requirements apply to participants?), 120.197 (Notifying SBA's Office of Inspector General of suspected fraud), 120.400 (Loan Guarantee Agreements), 120.410 (Requirements for all participating Lenders), 120.411 (Preferences), 120.412 (Other services Lenders may provide Borrowers), and 120.413 (Advertisement of relationship with SBA) of this chapter. An IDAP Lender and its contractor(s) are independent contractors that are responsible for their own actions with respect to an IDAP loan. SBA has no responsibility or liability for any claim by an IDAP Borrower, guarantor or other party alleging injury as a result of any allegedly wrongful action taken by an IDAP Lender or an employee, agent or contractor of an IDAP Lender.\n\n(b) Delegated authority. An IDAP loan must be processed, serviced and liquidated under an IDAP Lender's delegated authority provided by the supplemental Loan Guarantee Agreement for the IDAP loan program. Non-delegated processing is not available for the IDAP loan program. An IDAP Lender is responsible for all IDAP loan decisions regarding eligibility (including size) and creditworthiness. In determining creditworthiness, an IDAP Lender must use the existing practices and procedures that the IDAP Lender uses for its non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans of a similar size. The IDAP Lender's existing practices and procedures must be appropriate and generally accepted, proven and prudent credit evaluation processes and procedures, which may include credit scoring, and must ensure that there is reasonable assurance of repayment. In disbursing the IDAP loan, the IDAP Lender must use the same disbursement procedures and documentation as it uses for its similarly sized non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. An IDAP Lender is also responsible for confirming that all IDAP loan processing, closing, servicing and liquidation decisions are correct and that all IDAP Loan Program Requirements have been followed.\n\n(c) IDAP Lender reporting. An IDAP Lender must report on its IDAP loans in accordance with requirements established by SBA from time to time.\n\n(d) Servicing. Each IDAP Lender must service all of its IDAP loans in accordance with the existing practices and procedures that the IDAP Lender uses for its non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. In all circumstances, such practices and procedures must be commercially reasonable and consistent with prudent lending standards and in accordance with IDAP Loan Program Requirements. SBA's prior written consent is required for servicing actions that may have significant exposure implications for SBA. SBA may require written notice of other servicing actions it considers necessary for portfolio management purposes.\n\n(e) Liquidations. Each IDAP Lender must be responsible for liquidating its defaulted IDAP loans. IDAP loans will be liquidated in accordance with the existing practices and procedures that the IDAP Lender uses for its non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. In all circumstances, such practices and procedures must be commercially reasonable and consistent with prudent lending standards and in accordance with IDAP Loan Program Requirements. IDAP loans with de minimis value may, at the IDAP Lender's request and with SBA's approval, be liquidated by SBA or its agent(s). Significant liquidation actions taken on IDAP loans must be documented. The reimbursement of IDAP Lender liquidation expenses is limited to the amount of the recovery on the IDAP loan.\n\n(f) Purchase requests. An IDAP Lender may request SBA to purchase the guaranteed portion of an IDAP loan when there has been an uncured payment default exceeding 60 days or when the IDAP Borrower has declared bankruptcy. IDAP loans are subject to the 7(a) loan program requirements of §§ 120.520 (Purchase of 7(a) loan guarantees), 120.521 (What interest rate applies after SBA purchases its guaranteed portion?), 120.522 (Payment of accrued interest to the Lender or Registered Holder when SBA purchases the guaranteed portion), 120.523 (What is the “earliest uncured payment default”?), 120.524 (When is SBA released from liability on its guarantee?), 120.542 (Payment by SBA of legal fees and other expenses) and 120.546 (Loan asset sales) of this chapter.\n\n(g) Prohibition on secondary market sales, securitizations, loan participations and loan sales. An IDAP Lender may not sell the guaranteed portion of an IDAP loan in the secondary market, securitize the unguaranteed portion of an IDAP loan, participate any portion of an IDAP loan with another lender, or sell all of its interest in an IDAP loan.\n\n(h) Loan pledges. An IDAP Lender may pledge an IDAP loan subject to the 7(a) loan program requirements of §§ 120.434 and 120.435 of this chapter.\n\n(i) Oversight. All IDAP Lenders are subject to the supervision and enforcement provisions applicable to 7(a) Lenders in part 120, subpart I of this chapter (§§ 120.1000 through 120.1600). In addition, an IDAP Lender that is an SBA Supervised Lender (as defined in § 120.10) is subject to the requirements of §§ 120.460 through 120.490, as applicable.",

    "content": "(a)(1) General. The objective of the SBA's contracting programs is to assist small business concerns, including 8(a) BD Participants, HUBZone small business concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns, Women-Owned Small Businesses and Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses, in obtaining a fair share of Federal Government prime contracts, subcontracts, orders, and property sales. Therefore, these regulations apply to all types of Federal Government contracts, including Multiple Award Contracts, and contracts for architectural and engineering services, research, development, test and evaluation. Small business concerns must receive any award (including orders, and orders placed against Multiple Award Contracts) or contract, part of any such award or contract, any contract for the sale of Government property, or any contract resulting from a reverse auction, regardless of the place of performance, which SBA and the procuring or disposal agency determine to be in the interest of:\n\n(i) Maintaining or mobilizing the Nation's full productive capacity;\n\n(ii) War or national defense programs;\n\n(iii) Assuring that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts for property, services and construction for the Government in each industry category are placed with small business concerns; or\n\n(iv) Assuring that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property is made to small business concerns.\n\n(2) One acceptable offer. If the contracting officer receives only one acceptable offer from a responsible small business concern in response to any small or socioeconomic set-aside, the contracting officer should make an award to that firm.\n\n(b) SBA's responsibilities in the acquisition planning process—(1) SBA Procurement Center Representative (PCR) Responsibilities—\n\n(i) PCR Review—(A) SBA has PCRs who are generally located at Federal agencies and buying activities which have major contracting programs. At the SBA's discretion, PCRs may review any acquisition to determine whether a set-aside or sole-source award to a small business under one of SBA's programs is appropriate and to identify alternative strategies to maximize the participation of small businesses in the procurement. PCRs also advocate for the maximum practicable utilization of small business concerns in Federal contracting, including by advocating against the consolidation or bundling of contract requirements, as defined in § 125.1, and reviewing any justification provided by the agency for consolidation or bundling. This review includes acquisitions that are Multiple Award Contracts where the agency has not set-aside all or part of the acquisition or reserved the acquisition for small businesses. It also includes acquisitions where the agency has not set-aside orders placed against Multiple Award Contracts for small business concerns. Unless the contracting agency requests a review, PCRs will not review an acquisition by or on behalf of the Department of Defense if the acquisition is conducted for a foreign government pursuant to section 22 of the Arms Control Export Act (22 U.S.C. 2762), is humanitarian or civic assistance provided in conjunction with military operations as defined in 10 U.S.C. 401(e), is for a contingency operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13), is to be awarded pursuant to an agreement with the government of a foreign country in which Armed Forces of the United States are deployed, or where both the place of award and place of performance are entirely outside of the United States and its territories.\n\n(B) PCRs will work with the cognizant Small Business Specialist (SBS) and agency OSDBU or OSBP as early in the acquisition process as practicable to identify proposed solicitations that involve bundling, and with the agency acquisition officials to revise the acquisition strategies for such proposed solicitations, where appropriate, to increase the probability of participation by small businesses, including small business contract teams and Small Business Teaming Arrangements, as prime contractors.\n\n(C) In conjunction with their duties to promote the set-aside of procurements for small business, PCRs may identify small businesses that are capable of performing particular requirements.\n\n(D) PCRs will also ensure that any Federal agency decision made concerning the consolidation of contract requirements considers the use of small businesses and ways to provide small businesses with maximum opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors in the acquisition or sale of real property.\n\n(E) PCRs will review whether, for bundled and consolidated contracts that are recompeted, the amount of savings and benefits was achieved under the prior bundling or consolidation of contract requirements, that such savings and benefits will continue to be realized if the contract remains bundled or consolidated, or such savings and benefits would be greater if the procurement requirements were divided into separate solicitations suitable for award to small business concerns.\n\n(F) PCRs also advocate competitive procedures and recommend the breakout for competition of items and requirements which previously have not been competed when appropriate. They may appeal the failure by the buying activity to act favorably on a recommendation in accord with the appeal procedures in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. PCRs also review restrictions and obstacles to competition and make recommendations for improvement.\n\n(ii) PCR recommendations. The PCR must recommend to the procuring activity alternative procurement methods that would increase small business prime contract participation if a PCR believes that a proposed procurement includes in its statement of work goods or services currently being performed by a small business and is in a quantity or estimated dollar value the magnitude of which renders small business prime contract participation unlikely; will render small business prime contract participation unlikely (e.g., ensure geographical preferences are justified); or is for construction and seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects. If a PCR does not believe a bundled or consolidated requirement is necessary or justified the PCR shall advocate against the consolidation or bundling of such requirement and recommend to the procuring activity alternative procurement methods which would increase small business prime contract participation. Such alternatives may include:\n\n(A) Breaking up the procurement into smaller discrete procurements, especially construction acquisitions that can be procured as separate projects;\n\n(B) Breaking out one or more discrete components, for which a small business set-aside may be appropriate;\n\n(C) Reserving one or more awards for small businesses when issuing Multiple Award Contracts;\n\n(D) Using a partial set-aside;\n\n(E) Stating in the solicitation for a Multiple Award Contract that the orders will be set-aside for small businesses; and\n\n(F) Where the bundled or consolidated requirement is necessary and justified, the PCR will work with the procuring activity to tailor a strategy that preserves small business contract participation to the maximum extent practicable.\n\n(iii) PCR Recommendations for Small Business Teaming Arrangements and Subcontracting. The PCR will work to ensure that small business participation is maximized both at the prime contract level such as through Small Business Teaming Arrangements and through subcontracting opportunities. This may include the subcontracting considerations in source selections set forth in § 125.3(g), as well as the following:\n\n(A) Reviewing an agency's oversight of its subcontracting program, including its overall and individual assessment of a contractor's compliance with its small business subcontracting plans. The PCR will furnish a copy of the information to the SBA Commercial Market Representative (CMR) servicing the contractor;\n\n(B) Recommending that the solicitation and resultant contract specifically state the small business subcontracting goals that are expected of the contractor awardee;\n\n(C) Recommending that the small business subcontracting goals be based on total contract dollars in addition to goals based on a percentage of total subcontracted dollars;\n\n(D) Recommending that separate evaluation factors be established for evaluating the offerors' proposed approach to small business subcontracting participation in the subject procurement, the extent to which the offeror has met its small business subcontracting goals on previous contracts; and/or the extent to which the offeror actually paid small business subcontractors within the specified number of days;\n\n(E) Recommending that a contracting officer include an evaluation factor in a solicitation which evaluates an offeror's commitment to pay small business subcontractors within a specified number of days after receipt of payment from the Government for goods and services previously rendered by the small business subcontractor. The contracting officer will comparatively evaluate the proposed timelines. Such a commitment shall become a material part of the contract. The contracting officer must consider the contractor's compliance with the commitment in evaluating performance, including for purposes of contract continuation (such as exercising options);\n\n(F) For bundled and consolidated requirements, recommending that a separate evaluation factor with significant weight be established for evaluating the offeror's proposed approach to small business utilization, the extent to which the offeror has met its small business subcontracting goals on previous contracts; and the extent to which the other than small business offeror actually paid small business subcontractors within the specified number of days;\n\n(G) For bundled or consolidated requirements, recommending the solicitation state that the agency must evaluate offers from teams of small businesses the same as other offers, with due consideration to the capabilities and past performance of all proposed subcontractors. It may also include recommending that the agency reserve at least one award to a small business prime contractor with a Small Business Teaming Arrangement;\n\n(H) For Multiple Award Contracts and multiple award requirements above the substantial bundling threshold, recommending or requiring that the solicitation state that the agency will solicit offers from small business concerns and small business concerns with Small Business Teaming Arrangements;\n\n(I) For consolidated contracts, ensuring that agencies have provided small business concerns with appropriate opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors and making recommendations on such opportunities as appropriate; and\n\n(J) Recommending paragraphs (B) through (I) above apply to an ordering agency placing an order against a Multiple Award Contract or Agreement.\n\n(iv) PCRs will consult with the agency OSDBU regarding agency decisions to convert an activity performed by a small business concern to an activity performed by a Federal employee.\n\n(v) PCRs may receive unsolicited proposals from small business concerns and will transmit those proposals to the agency personnel responsible for reviewing such proposals. The agency personnel shall provide the PCR with information regarding the disposition of such proposal.\n\n(2) Appeals of PCR recommendations. In cases where there is disagreement between a PCR and the contracting officer over the suitability of a particular acquisition for a small business set-aside, partial set-aside or reserve, whether or not the acquisition is a bundled, substantially bundled or consolidated requirement, the PCR may initiate an appeal to the head of the contracting activity. If the head of the contracting activity agrees with the contracting officer, SBA may appeal the matter to the Secretary of the Department or head of the agency. The time limits for such appeals are set forth in FAR subpart 19.5 (48 CFR 19.5).\n\n(c) Procuring Agency Responsibilities—(1) Requirement to Foster Small Business Participation. The Small Business Act requires each Federal agency to foster the participation of small business concerns as prime contractors and subcontractors in the contracting opportunities of the Government regardless of the place of performance of the contract. In addition, Federal agencies must ensure that all bundled and consolidated contracts contain the required analysis and justification and provide small business concerns with appropriate opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors. Agency acquisition planners must:\n\n(i) Structure procurement requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns, including small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, certified HUBZone small business concerns , 8(a) BD small business concerns (including those owned by ANCs, Indian Tribes and NHOs), and small business concerns owned and controlled by women;\n\n(ii) Avoid unnecessary and unjustified bundling of contracts or consolidation of contract requirements that inhibits or precludes small business participation in procurements as prime contractors;\n\n(iii) Follow the limitations on use of consolidated contracts;\n\n(iv) With respect to any work to be performed the amount of which would exceed the maximum amount of any contract for which a surety may be guaranteed against loss under 15 U.S.C. 694b, to the extent practicable, place contracts so as to allow more than one small business concern to perform such work;\n\n(v) Provide SBA the necessary information relating to the acquisition under review at least 30 days prior to issuance of a solicitation. This includes providing PCRs (to the extent allowable pursuant to their security clearance) copies of all documents relating to the acquisition under review, including, but not limited to, the performance of work statement/statement of work, technical data, market research, hard copies or their electronic equivalents of Department of Defense (DoD) Form 2579 or equivalent, and other relevant information. The DoD Form 2579 or equivalent must be sent electronically to the PCR (or if a PCR is not assigned to the procuring activity, to the SBA Office of Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the buying activity is located);\n\n(vi) Provide opportunities for the participation of small business concerns during acquisition planning processes and in acquisition plans; and\n\n(vii) Invite the participation of the appropriate Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization in acquisition planning processes and provide that Director with access to acquisition plans.\n\n(2) Requirement for market research. Each agency, as part of its acquisition planning, must conduct market research to determine the type and extent of foreseeable small business participation in the acquisition. In addition, each agency must conduct market research and any required analysis and justifications before proceeding with an acquisition strategy that could lead to a bundled, substantially bundled, or consolidated contract. The purpose of the market research and analysis is to determine whether the bundling or consolidation of the requirements is necessary and justified and all statutory requirements for such a strategy have been met. Agencies should be as broad as possible in their search for qualified small businesses, using key words as well as NAICS codes in their examination of the System for Award Management (SAM) and the Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS), and must not place unnecessary and unjustified restrictions when conducting market research (e.g., requiring that small businesses prove they can provide the best scientific and technological sources) when determining whether to set-aside, partially set-aside, reserve or sole source a requirement to small businesses. During the market research phase, the acquisition team must consult with the applicable PCR (or if a PCR is not assigned to the procuring activity, the SBA Office of Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the buying activity is located) and the activity's Small Business Specialist.\n\n(3) Proposed Acquisition Strategy. A procuring activity must provide to the applicable PCR (or to the SBA Office of Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the buying activity is located if a PCR is not assigned to the procuring activity) at least 30 days prior to a solicitation's issuance:\n\n(i) A copy of a proposed acquisition strategy (e.g., DoD Form 2579, or equivalent) whenever a proposed acquisition strategy:\n\n(A) Includes in its description goods or services the magnitude of the quantity or estimated dollar value of which would render small business prime contract participation unlikely;\n\n(B) Seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects;\n\n(C) Is a bundled or substantially bundled requirement; or\n\n(D) Is a consolidation of contract requirements;\n\n(ii) A written statement explaining why, if the proposed acquisition strategy involves a bundled or consolidated requirement, the procuring activity believes that the bundled or consolidated requirement is necessary and justified; the analysis required by paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section; the acquisition plan; any bundling information required under paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and any other relevant information. The PCR and agency OSDBU or OSBP, as applicable, must then work together to develop alternative acquisition strategies identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to enhance small business participation;\n\n(iii) All required clearances for the bundled, substantially bundled, or consolidated requirement; and\n\n(iv) A written statement explaining why—if the description of the requirement includes goods or services currently being performed by a small business and the magnitude of the quantity or estimated dollar value of the proposed procurement would render small business prime contract participation unlikely, or if a proposed procurement for construction seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects—\n\n(A) The proposed acquisition cannot be divided into reasonably small lots to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement;\n\n(B) Delivery schedules cannot be established on a basis that will encourage small business participation;\n\n(C) The proposed acquisition cannot be offered so as to make small business participation likely; or\n\n(D) Construction cannot be procured through separate discrete projects.\n\n(4) Procuring Agency Small Business Specialist (SBS) Responsibilities.\n\n(i) As early in the acquisition planning process as practicable—but no later than 30 days before the issuance of a solicitation, or prior to placing an order without a solicitation—the procuring activity must coordinate with the procuring activity's SBS when the acquisition strategy contemplates an acquisition meeting the dollar amounts set forth for substantial bundling. If the acquisition strategy contemplates Multiple Award Contracts or orders under the GSA Multiple Award Schedule Program or a task or delivery order contract awarded by another agency, these thresholds apply to the cumulative estimated value of the Multiple Award Contracts or orders, including options. The procuring activity is not required to coordinate with its SBS if the contract or order is entirely set-aside for small business concerns, or small businesses under one of SBA's small business programs, as authorized under the Small Business Act.\n\n(ii) The SBS must notify the agency OSDBU or OSBP if the agency's acquisition strategy or plan includes bundled or consolidated requirements that the agency has not identified as bundled, or includes unnecessary or unjustified bundling of requirements. If the strategy involves substantial bundling, the SBS must assist in identifying alternative strategies that would reduce or minimize the scope of the bundling.\n\n(iii) The SBS must coordinate with the procuring activity and PCR on all required determinations and findings for bundling and/or consolidation, and acquisition planning and strategy documentation.\n\n(5) OSDBU and OSBP Oversight Functions. The Agency OSDBU or OSBP must:\n\n(i) Conduct annual reviews to assess the:\n\n(A) Extent to which small businesses are receiving their fair share of Federal procurements, including contract opportunities under programs administered under the Small Business Act;\n\n(B) Adequacy of the bundling or consolidation documentation and justification; and\n\n(C) Adequacy of actions taken to mitigate the effects of necessary and justified contract bundling or consolidation on small businesses (e.g., review agency oversight of prime contractor subcontracting plan compliance under the subcontracting program);\n\n(ii) Provide a copy of the assessment under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section to the agency head and SBA's Administrator;\n\n(iii) Identify proposed solicitations that involve significant bundling of contract requirements, and work with the agency acquisition officials and the SBA to revise the procurement strategies for such proposed solicitations to increase the probability of participation by small businesses as prime contractors through Small Business Teaming Arrangements;\n\n(iv) Facilitate small business participation as subcontractors and suppliers, if a solicitation for a substantially bundled contract is to be issued;\n\n(v) Assist small business concerns to obtain payments, required late payment interest penalties, or information regarding payments due to such concerns from an executive agency or a contractor, in conformity with chapter 39 of Title 31 or any other protection for contractors or subcontractors (including suppliers) that is included in the FAR or any individual agency supplement to such Government-wide regulation;\n\n(vi) Cooperate, and consult on a regular basis with the SBA with respect to carrying out these functions and duties;\n\n(vii) Make recommendations to contracting officers as to whether a particular contract requirement should be awarded to any type of small business. The Contracting Officer must document any reason not to accept such recommendations and include the documentation in the appropriate contract file; and\n\n(viii) Coordinate on any acquisition planning and strategy documentation, including bundling and consolidation determinations at the agency level.\n\n(6) Prohibition on competitions requiring or favoring additional socioeconomic certifications. A procuring activity cannot create a small business set-aside or reserve (for either a contract, order or agreement) that requires multiple socioeconomic certifications in addition to a size certification (e.g., a competition cannot be limited only to small business concerns that are also 8(a) and HUBZone certified) or give evaluation preferences to concerns having multiple socioeconomic certifications.\n\n(7) Communication on Achieving Goals. All Senior Procurement Executives, senior program managers, Directors of OSDBU or Directors of OSBP must communicate to their subordinates the importance of achieving small business goals and ensuring that a fair proportion of awards are made to small businesses.\n\n(d) Contract Consolidation and Bundling—(1) Limitation on the Use of Consolidated Contracts. (i) An agency may not conduct an acquisition that is a consolidation of contract requirements unless the Senior Procurement Executive or Chief Acquisition Officer for the Federal agency, before carrying out the acquisition strategy:\n\n(A) Conducts adequate market research;\n\n(B) Identifies any alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of consolidation of contract requirements;\n\n(C) Makes a written determination, which is coordinated with the agency's OSDBU/OSBP, that the consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified;\n\n(D) Identifies any negative impact by the acquisition strategy on contracting with small business concerns; and\n\n(E) Ensures that steps will be taken to include small business concerns in the acquisition strategy.\n\n(ii) A Senior Procurement Executive or Chief Acquisition Officer may determine that an acquisition strategy involving a consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified.\n\n(A) A consolidation of contract requirements may be necessary and justified if the benefits of the acquisition strategy substantially exceed the benefits of each of the possible alternative contracting approaches identified under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B).\n\n(B) The benefits may include cost savings and/or price reduction, quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency, reduction in acquisition cycle times, better terms and conditions, and any other benefits that individually, in combination, or in the aggregate would lead to: benefits equivalent to 10 percent of the contract or order value (including options) where the contract or order value is $94 million or less; or benefits equivalent to 5 percent of the contract or order value (including options) or $9.4 million, whichever is greater, where the contract or order value exceeds $94 million.\n\n(C) Savings in administrative or personnel costs alone do not constitute a sufficient justification for a consolidation of contract requirements in a procurement unless the expected total amount of the cost savings, as determined by the Senior Procurement Executive or Chief Acquisition Officer, is expected to be substantial in relation to the total cost of the procurement. To be substantial, such administrative or personnel cost savings must be at least 10 percent of the contract value (including options).\n\n(iii) Each agency must ensure that any decision made concerning the consolidation of contract requirements considers the use of small businesses and ways to provide small businesses with opportunities to participate as prime contractors and subcontractors in the acquisition.\n\n(iv) If the consolidated requirement is also considered a bundled requirement, then the contracting officer must instead follow the provisions regarding bundling set forth in paragraphs (d)(2) through (7) of this section.\n\n(v) Not later than 7 days after making a determination that an acquisition strategy involving a consolidation of contract requirements is necessary and justified under subparagraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE) or Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO), or designee, shall publish a notice on the Government Point of Entry (GPE) that such determination has been made. Any solicitation for a procurement related to the acquisition strategy shall not be issued earlier than 7 days after such notice is published. Along with the publication of the solicitation, the SPE or CAO (or designee) must publish in the GPE the justification for the determination, which shall include the information in paragraphs (d)(1)(i)(A) through (E) of this section.\n\n(2) Limitation on the Use of Contract Bundling. (i) When the procuring activity intends to proceed with an acquisition involving bundled or substantially bundled procurement requirements, it must document the acquisition strategy to include a determination that the bundling is necessary and justified, when compared to the benefits that could be derived from meeting the agency's requirements through separate smaller contracts.\n\n(ii) A bundled requirement is necessary and justified if, as compared to the benefits that the procuring activity would derive from contracting to meet those requirements if not bundled, it would derive measurably substantial benefits. The procuring activity must quantify the identified benefits and explain how their impact would be measurably substantial. This analysis must include quantification of the reduction or increase in price of the proposed bundled strategy as compared to the cumulative value of the separate contracts. The benefits may include cost savings and/or price reduction, quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency, reduction in acquisition cycle times, better terms and conditions, and any other benefits that individually, in combination, or in the aggregate would lead to:\n\n(A) Benefits equivalent to 10 percent of the contract or order value (including options), where the contract or order value is $94 million or less; or\n\n(B) Benefits equivalent to 5 percent of the contract or order value (including options) or $9.4 million, whichever is greater, where the contract or order value exceeds $94 million.\n\n(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the Senior Procurement Executives or the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology (for other Defense Agencies) in the Department of Defense and the Deputy Secretary or equivalent in civilian agencies may, on a non-delegable basis, determine that a bundled requirement is necessary and justified when:\n\n(A) There are benefits that do not meet the thresholds set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section but, in the aggregate, are critical to the agency's mission success; and\n\n(B) The procurement strategy provides for maximum practicable participation by small business.\n\n(iv) The reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone must not be a justification for bundling of contract requirements unless the administrative or personnel cost savings are expected to be substantial, in relation to the dollar value of the procurement to be bundled (including options). To be substantial, such administrative or personnel cost savings must be at least 10 percent of the contract value (including options).\n\n(v) In assessing whether cost savings and/or a price reduction would be achieved through bundling, the procuring activity and SBA must compare the price that has been charged by small businesses for the work that they have performed and, where available, the price that could have been or could be charged by small businesses for the work not previously performed by small business.\n\n(vi) The substantial benefit analysis set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section is still required where a requirement is subject to a Cost Comparison Analysis under OMB Circular A-76.\n\n(3) Limitations on the Use of Substantial Bundling. Where a proposed procurement strategy involves a Substantial Bundling of contract requirements, the procuring agency must, in the documentation of that strategy, include a determination that the anticipated benefits of the proposed bundled contract justify its use, and must include, at a minimum:\n\n(i) The analysis for bundled requirements set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section;\n\n(ii) An assessment of the specific impediments to participation by small business concerns as prime contractors that will result from the substantial bundling;\n\n(iii) Actions designed to maximize small business participation as prime contractors, including provisions that encourage small business teaming for the substantially bundled requirement;\n\n(iv) Actions designed to maximize small business participation as subcontractors (including suppliers) at any tier under the contract or contracts that may be awarded to meet the requirements; and\n\n(v) The identification of the alternative strategies that would reduce or minimize the scope of the bundling, and the rationale for not choosing those alternatives (i.e., consider the strategies under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section).\n\n(4) Significant Subcontracting Opportunities in Justified Consolidated, Bundled and Substantially Bundled Requirements.\n\n(i) Where a justified consolidated, bundled, or substantially bundled requirement offers a significant opportunity for subcontracting, the procuring agency must designate the following factors as significant factors in evaluating offers:\n\n(A) A factor that is based on the rate of participation provided under the subcontracting plan for small business in the performance of the contract; and\n\n(B) For the evaluation of past performance of an offeror, a factor that is based on the extent to which the offeror attained applicable goals for small business participation in the performance of contracts.\n\n(ii) Where the offeror for such a contract qualifies as a small business concern, the procuring agency must give to the offeror the highest score possible for the evaluation factors identified above.\n\n(5) Notification to Current Small Business Contractors of Intent to Bundle. The procuring activity must notify each small business which is performing a contract that it intends to bundle that requirement with one or more other requirements at least 30 days prior to the issuance of the solicitation for the bundled or substantially bundled requirement. The procuring activity, at that time, should also provide to the small business the name, phone number and address of the applicable SBA PCR (or if a PCR is not assigned to the procuring activity, the SBA Office of Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the buying activity is located). This notification must be documented in the contract file.\n\n(6) Notification to Public of Rationale for Bundled Requirement. The head of a Federal agency must publish on the agency's Web site a list and rationale for any bundled requirement for which the agency solicited offers or issued an award. The notification must be made within 30 days of the agency's data certification regarding the validity and verification of data entered in that Federal Procurement Data Base to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy. However, to foster transparency in Federal procurement, the agency is encouraged to provide such notification before issuance of the solicitation.\n\n(7) Notification to public of rationale for substantial bundling. If the head of a contracting agency determines that an acquisition plan for a procurement involves a substantial bundling of contract requirements, the head of a contracting agency shall publish a notice on the GPE that such determination has been made not later than 7 days after making such determination. Any solicitation for a procurement related to the acquisition plan may not be published earlier than 7 days after such notice is published. Along with the publication of the solicitation, the head of a contracting agency shall publish in the GPE a justification for the determination, which shall include the following information:\n\n(i) The specific benefits anticipated to be derived from the bundling of contract requirements and a determination that such benefits justify the bundling;\n\n(ii) An identification of any alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of bundling of contract requirements;\n\n(iii) An assessment of the specific impediments to participation by small business concerns as prime contractors that result from the bundling of contract requirements; and\n\n(iv) The specific actions designed to maximize participation of small business concerns as subcontractors (including suppliers) at various tiers under the contract or contracts that are awarded to meet the requirements.\n\n(8) Notification to SBA of Recompeted Bundled or Consolidated Requirement. For each bundled or consolidated contract that is to be recompeted (even if additional requirements have been added or deleted) the procuring agency must notify SBA's PCR as soon as possible but no later than 30 days prior to issuance of the solicitation of:\n\n(i) The amount of savings and benefits achieved under the prior bundling or consolidation of contract requirements;\n\n(ii) Whether such savings and benefits will continue to be realized if the contract remains bundled or consolidated; and\n\n(iii) Whether such savings and benefits would be greater if the procurement requirements were divided into separate solicitations suitable for award to small business concerns.\n\n(e) Multiple Award Contract—(1) General.(i) The contracting officer must set-aside a Multiple Award Contract if the requirements for a set-aside are met. This includes set-asides for small businesses, 8(a) Participants, HUBZone SBCs, SDVO SBCs, WOSBs or EDWOSBs.\n\n(ii) The contracting officer in his or her discretion may partially set-aside or reserve a Multiple Award Contract, or set aside, or preserve the right to set aside, orders against a Multiple Award Contract that was not itself set aside for small business. The ultimate decision of whether to use any of the above-mentioned tools in any given procurement action is a decision of the contracting agency.\n\n(iii) The procuring agency contracting officer must document the contract file and explain why the procuring agency did not partially set-aside or reserve a Multiple Award Contract, or set-aside orders issued against a Multiple Award Contract, when these authorities could have been used.\n\n(2) Total Set-aside of Multiple Award Contracts. (i) The contracting officer must conduct market research to determine whether the “rule of two” can be met. If the “rule of two” can be met, the contracting officer must follow the procedures for a set-aside set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.\n\n(ii) The contracting officer must assign a NAICS code to the solicitation for the Multiple Award Contract and each order pursuant to § 121.402(c) of this chapter. See § 121.404 for further determination on size status for the Multiple Award Contract and each order issued against that contract.\n\n(iii) When drafting the solicitation for the contract, agencies should consider an “on-ramp” provision that permits the agency to refresh the awards by adding more small business contractors throughout the life of the contract. Agencies should also consider the need to “off-ramp” existing contractors that no longer qualify as small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract (e.g., termination for convenience).\n\n(iv) A business must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see § 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see § 121.406(b)), if applicable, during each performance period of the contract (e.g., the base term and each subsequent option period). However, the contracting officer, in his or her discretion, may require the contractor perform the applicable amount of work or comply with the nonmanufacturer rule for each order awarded under the contract.\n\n(3) Partial Set-asides of Multiple Award Contracts. (i) A contracting officer may partially set-aside a multiple award contract when: market research indicates that a total set-aside is not appropriate; the procurement can be broken up into smaller discrete portions or discrete categories such as by Contract Line Items, Special Item Numbers, Sectors or Functional Areas or other equivalent; and two or more small business concerns, 8(a) BD Participants, HUBZone SBCs, SDVO SBCs, WOSBs or EDWOSBs are expected to submit an offer on the set-aside part or parts of the requirement at a fair market price. A contracting officer has the discretion, but is not required, to set-aside the discrete portions or categories for different small businesses participating in SBA's small business programs (e.g., CLIN 0001, 8(a) set-aside; CLIN 0002, HUBZone set-aside; CLIN 0003, SDVO SBC set-aside; CLIN 0004, WOSB set-aside; CLIN 0005 EDWOSB set-aside; CLIN 0006, small business set-aside). If the contracting officer decides to partially set-aside a Multiple Award Contract, the contracting officer must follow the procedures for a set-aside set forth in paragraph (f) of this section for the part or parts of the contract that have been set-aside.\n\n(ii) The contracting officer must assign a NAICS code and corresponding size standard to the solicitation for the Multiple Award Contract and each order issued against the Multiple Award Contract pursuant to § 121.402(c) of this chapter. See § 121.404 for further determination on size status for the Multiple Award Contract and each order issued against that contract.\n\n(iii) A contracting officer must state in the solicitation that the small business will not compete against other-than-small businesses for any order issued against that part or parts of the Multiple Award Contract that are set-aside.\n\n(iv) A contracting officer must state in the solicitation that the small business will be permitted to compete against other-than-small businesses for an order issued against the portion of the Multiple Award Contract that has not been partially set-aside if the small business submits an offer for the non-set-aside portion. The business concern will not have to comply with the limitations on subcontracting (see § 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule for any order issued against the Multiple Award Contract if the order is competed and awarded under the portion of the contract that is not set-aside.\n\n(v) When drafting the solicitation for the contract, agencies should consider an “on ramp” provision that permits the agency to refresh these awards by adding more small business contractors to that portion of the contract that was set-aside throughout the life of the contract. Agencies should also consider the need to ”off ramp” existing contractors that no longer qualify as small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract (e.g., termination for convenience).\n\n(vi) The small business must submit one offer that addresses each part of the solicitation for which it wants to compete. A small business (or 8(a) Participant, HUBZone SBC, SDVO SBC or ED/WOSB) is not required to submit an offer on the part of the solicitation that is not set-aside. However, a small business may choose to submit an offer on the part or parts of the solicitation that have been set-aside and/or on the parts that have not been set-aside.\n\n(vii) A small business must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see § 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see § 121.406(b)), if applicable, during each performance period of the contract (e.g., during the base term and then during option period thereafter). However, the contracting officer, in his or her discretion, may require the contractor perform the applicable amount of work or comply with the nonmanufacturer rule for each order awarded under the contract.\n\n(4) Reserves of Multiple Award Contracts Awarded in Full and Open Competition. (i) A contracting officer may reserve one or more awards for small business where:\n\n(A) The market research and recent past experience evidence that—\n\n(1) At least two small businesses, 8(a) BD Participants, HUBZone SBCs, SDVO SBCs, WOSBs or EDWOSBs could perform one part of the requirement, but the contracting officer was unable to divide the requirement into smaller discrete portions or discrete categories by utilizing individual Contract Line Items (CLINs), Special Item Numbers (SINs), Functional Areas (FAs), or other equivalent; or\n\n(2) At least one small business, 8(a) BD Participant, HUBZone SBC, SDVO SBC, WOSB or EDWOSB can perform the entire requirement, but there is not a reasonable expectation of receiving at least two offers from small business concerns, 8(a) BD Participants, HUBZone SBCs, SDVO SBCs, WOSBs or EDWOSBs at a fair market price for all the work contemplated throughout the term of the contract; or\n\n(B) The contracting officer makes:\n\n(1) Two or more contract awards to any one type of small business concern (e.g., small business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVO SBC, WOSB or EDWOSB) and competes any orders solely amongst the specified types of small business concerns if the “rule of two” or any alternative set-aside requirements provided in the small business program have been met;\n\n(2) Several awards to several different types of small businesses (e.g., one to 8(a), one to HUBZone, one to SDVO SBC, one to WOSB or EDWOSB) and competes any orders solely amongst all of the small business concerns if the “rule of two” has been met; or\n\n(3) One contract award to any one type of small business concern (e.g., small business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVO SBC, WOSB or EDWOSB) and subsequently issues orders directly to that concern.\n\n(ii) If the contracting officer decides to reserve a multiple award contract established through full and open competition, the contracting officer must assign a NAICS code to the solicitation for the Multiple Award Contract and each order issued against the Multiple Award Contract pursuant to § 121.402(c) of this chapter. See § 121.404 for further determination on size status for the Multiple Award Contract and each order issued against that contract.\n\n(iii) A contracting officer must state in the solicitation that if there are two or more contract awards to any one type of small business concern (e.g., small business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVO SBC, WOSB or EDWOSB), the agency may compete any orders solely amongst the specified types of small business concerns if the “rule of two” or an alternative set-aside requirement provided in the small business program have been met.\n\n(iv) A contracting officer must state in the solicitation that if there are several awards to several different types of small businesses (e.g., one to 8(a), one to HUBZone, one to SDVO SBC, one to WOSB or EDWOSB), the agency may compete any orders solely amongst all of the small business concerns if the “rule of two” has been met.\n\n(v) A contracting officer must state in the solicitation that if there is only one contract award to any one type of small business concern (e.g., small business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVO SBC, WOSB or EDWOSB), the agency may issue orders directly to that concern for work that it can perform.\n\n(vi) A contracting officers may, but is not required to, set forth targets in the contract showing the estimated dollar value or percentage of the total contract to be awarded to small businesses.\n\n(vii) A small business offeror must submit one offer that addresses each part of the solicitation for which it wants to compete.\n\n(viii) Small businesses are permitted to compete against other-than-small businesses for an order issued against the Multiple Award Contract if agency issued the small business a contract for those supplies or services.\n\n(ix) A business must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see § 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see § 121.406(b)), if applicable, for any order issued against the Multiple Award Contract if the order is set aside or awarded on a sole source basis. However, a business need not comply with the limitations on subcontracting provisions (see § 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule for any order issued against the Multiple Award Contract if the order is competed amongst small and other-than-small business concerns.\n\n(5) Reserve of Multiple Award Contracts that are Bundled.\n\n(i) If the contracting officer decides to reserve a multiple award contract established through full and open competition that is a bundled contract, the contracting officer must assign a NAICS code to the solicitation for the Multiple Award Contract and each order issued against the Multiple Award Contract pursuant to § 121.402(c) of this chapter. See § 121.404 for further determination on size status for the Multiple Award Contract and each order issued against that contract.\n\n(ii) The Small Business Teaming Arrangement must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see § 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see § 121.406(b)), if applicable, on all orders issued against the Multiple Award Contract, although the cooperative efforts of the team members will be considered in determining whether the subcontracting limitations requirement is met (see § 125.6(j)).\n\n(iii) Team members of the Small Business Teaming Arrangement will not be affiliated for the specific solicitation or contract (see § 121.103(b)(8)).\n\n(6) Set-aside of orders against Multiple Award Contracts.\n\n(i) Notwithstanding the fair opportunity requirements set forth in 10 U.S.C. 2304c and 41 U.S.C. 4106(c), a contracting officer may set aside orders for small businesses, eligible 8(a) Participants, certified HUBZone small business concerns, SDVO small business concerns, WOSBs, and EDWOSBs against full and open Multiple Award Contracts. In addition, a contracting officer may set aside orders for eligible 8(a) Participants, certified HUBZone small business concerns, SDVO small business concerns, WOSBs, and EDWOSBs against total small business set-aside Multiple Award Contracts, partial small business set-aside Multiple Award Contracts, and small business reserves of Multiple Award Contracts awarded in full and open competition. Although a contracting officer can set aside orders issued under a small business set-aside Multiple Award Contract or reserve to any subcategory of small businesses, contracting officers are encouraged to review the award dollars under the Multiple Award Contract and aim to make available for award at least 50% of the award dollars under the Multiple Award Contract to all contract holders of the underlying small business set-aside Multiple Award Contract or reserve. However, a contracting officer may not further set aside orders for specific types of small business concerns against Multiple Award Contracts that are set-aside or reserved for eligible 8(a) Participants, certified HUBZone small business concerns, SDVO small business concerns, WOSBs, and EDWOSBs (e.g., a contracting officer cannot set-aside an order for 8(a) Participants that are also certified HUBZone small business concerns against an 8(a) Multiple Award Contract).\n\n(ii) The contracting officer may state in the solicitation and resulting contract for the Multiple Award Contract that:\n\n(A) Based on the results of market research, orders issued against the Multiple Award Contract will be set-aside for small businesses or any subcategory of small businesses whenever the “rule of two” or any alternative set-aside requirements provided in the small business program have been met; or\n\n(B) The agency is preserving the right to consider set-asides using the “rule of two” or any alternative set-aside requirements provided in the small business program, on an order-by-order basis.\n\n(iii) For the acquisition of orders valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), the contracting officer may set-aside the order for small businesses, 8(a) BD Participants, HUBZone SBCs, SDVO SBCs, WOSBs or EDWOSBs in accordance with the relevant program's regulations. For the acquisition of orders valued above the SAT, the contracting officer shall first consider whether there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two 8(a) BD Participants, HUBZone SBCs, SDVO SBCs, WOSBs or EDWOSBs in accordance with the program's regulations, before setting aside the requirement as a small business set-aside. There is no order of precedence among the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVO SBC or WOSB programs.\n\n(iv) The contracting officer must assign a NAICS code to the solicitation for each order issued against the Multiple Award Contract pursuant to § 121.402(c) of this chapter. See § 121.404 for further determination on size status for each order issued against that contract.\n\n(v) A business must comply with applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see § 125.6) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see § 121.406(b)), if applicable in the performance of each order that is set-aside against the contract.\n\n(7) Partial set-aside and reserve. A procuring activity may have both a partial small business set-aside and a small business reserve on the same contract. A partial set-aside can be done for one or more CLINs that must be set-aside for small business and a reserve could also be done on the same procurement for other items or services where a contracting officer would have discretion to utilize the small business reserve where appropriate.\n\n(8) Tiered evaluation of offers, or cascading. An agency cannot create a tiered evaluation of offers or “cascade” unless it has specific statutory authority to do so. This is a procedure used in negotiated acquisitions when the contracting officer establishes a tiered or cascading order of precedence for evaluating offers that is specified in the solicitation, which states that if no award can be made at the first tier, it will evaluate offers at the next lower tier, until award can be made. For example, unless the agency has specific statutory authority to do so, an agency is not permitted to state an intention to award one contract to an 8(a) BD Participant and one to a HUBZone SBC, but only if no awards are made to 8(a) BD Participants.\n\n(f) Contracting Among Small Business Programs—(1) Acquisitions Valued At or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. The contracting officer shall set aside any acquisition with an anticipated dollar value exceeding the Micro-purchase Threshold but not exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101) for small business concerns when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two small business concerns that are competitive in terms of quality and delivery and award will be made at fair market prices. This requirement does not preclude a contracting officer from making an award to a small business under the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVO SBC or WOSB Programs.\n\n(2) Acquisitions Valued Above the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. (i) The contracting officer shall set aside any acquisition with an anticipated dollar value exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101) for small business concerns when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two small business concerns that are competitive in terms of quality and delivery and award will be made at fair market prices. However, after conducting market research, the contracting officer shall first consider a set-aside or sole source award (if the sole source award is permitted by statute or regulation) under the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVO SBC or WOSB programs before setting aside the requirement as a small business set-aside. There is no order of precedence among the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVO SBC or WOSB programs. The contracting officer must document the contract file with the rationale used to support the specific set-aside, including the type and extent of market research conducted. In addition, the contracting officer must document the contract file showing that the apparent successful offeror's certifications in the System for Award Management (SAM) (or successor system) and associated representations were reviewed.\n\n(ii) SBA believes that Progress in fulfilling the various small business goals, as well as other factors such as the results of market research, programmatic needs specific to the procuring agency, anticipated award price, and the acquisition history, will be considered in making a decision as to which program to use for the acquisition.\n\n(g) Capabilities, past performance, and experience. When an offer of a small business prime contractor includes a proposed team of small business subcontractors and specifically identifies the first-tier subcontractor(s) in the proposal, the head of the agency must consider the capabilities, past performance, and experience of each first tier subcontractor that is part of the team as the capabilities, past performance, and experience of the small business prime contractor if the capabilities, past performance, and experience of the small business prime does not independently demonstrate capabilities and past performance necessary for award.\n\n[61 FR 3312, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 63 FR 31908, June 11, 1998; 64 FR 57370, Oct. 25, 1999; 65 FR 45833, July 26, 2000; 68 FR 60012, Oct. 20, 2003; 74 FR 46887, Sept. 14, 2009; 75 FR 62281, Oct. 7, 2010; 76 FR 63547, Oct. 12, 2011; 77 FR 1860, Jan. 12, 2012; 78 FR 61135, Oct. 2, 2013; 81 FR 34261, May 31, 2016; 81 FR 48585, July 25, 2016; 84 FR 65239, Nov. 26, 2019; 84 FR 65662, Nov. 29, 2019; 85 FR 66191, Oct. 16, 2020; 88 FR 26210, Apr. 27, 2023; 89 FR 102491, Dec. 17, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. The purpose of the subcontracting assistance program is to provide the maximum practicable subcontracting opportunities for small business concerns, including small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans, certified small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, certified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women. The subcontracting assistance program implements section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, which includes the requirement that, unless otherwise exempt, other than small business concerns awarded contracts that offer subcontracting possibilities by the Federal Government in excess of $750,000, or in excess of $1,500,000 for construction of a public facility, must submit a subcontracting plan to the appropriate contracting agency. The Federal Acquisition Regulation sets forth the requirements for subcontracting plans in 48 CFR 19.7, and the clause at 48 CFR 52.219-9.\n\n(1) Subcontract under this section means a legally binding agreement between a contractor that is already under contract to another party to perform work and a third party (other than one involving an employer-employee relationship), hereinafter referred to as the subcontractor, for the subcontractor to perform a part or all of the work that the contractor has undertaken.\n\n(i) Subcontract award data reported by prime contractors and subcontractors shall be limited to awards made to their immediate next-tier subcontractors. Credit cannot be taken for awards made beyond the immediate next-tier, except as follows:\n\n(A) The contractor or subcontractor has been designated to receive a small business or small disadvantaged business credit from an ANC or Indian Tribe; or\n\n(B) Purchases from a corporation, company, or subdivision that is an affiliate of the prime contractor or subcontractor, or a joint venture in which the contractor is one of the joint venturers, are not included in the subcontracting base. Subcontracts by first-tier affiliates, and subcontracts by a joint venture in which the prime contractor is one of the joint venturers, shall be treated as subcontracts of the prime.\n\n(C) Where the subcontracting goals pertain only to a single contract with one Federal agency, the contractor may elect to receive credit for small business concerns performing as first-tier subcontractors or subcontractors at any tier pursuant to the subcontracting plans required under paragraph (c) of this section in an amount equal to the dollar value of work awarded to such small business concerns. The election must be recorded in the subcontracting plan. If the contractor elects to receive credit for subcontractors at any tier, the following requirements apply:\n\n(1) The prime contractor must incorporate the subcontracting-plan goals of their lower-tier subcontractors in its individual-subcontracting-plan goals.\n\n(2) To receive credit for their subcontracting, lower-tier subcontractors must have their own individual subcontracting plans.\n\n(3) The prime contractor and any subcontractor with a subcontracting plan are responsible for reporting on subcontracting performance under their contracts or subcontracts at their first tier. This reporting method applies to both individual subcontracting reports and summary subcontracting reports.\n\n(4) The prime contractor's performance under its individual subcontracting plan will be calculated by aggregating the prime contractor's first-tier subcontracting achievements with the achievements of the prime contractor's lower-tier subcontractors that have flow-down subcontracting plans.\n\n(5) If the subcontracting goals pertain to more than one contract with one or more Federal agencies, or to one contract with more than one Federal agency, the prime contractor shall receive credit only for first-tier subcontractors that are small business concerns. This restriction applies to all commercial plans, all comprehensive subcontracting plans with the Department of Defense, governmentwide contracts, and multi-agency contracts.\n\n(D) Other-than-small prime contractors and subcontractors with subcontracting plans shall report on their subcontracting performance on the Summary Subcontracting report (SSR) at their first tier only.\n\n(ii) Only subcontracts involving performance in the United States or its outlying areas should be included, with the exception of subcontracts under a contract awarded by the U.S. Department of State or any other agency that has statutory or regulatory authority to require subcontracting plans for subcontracts performed outside the United States and its outlying areas and subcontracts for foreign military sales unless waived in accordance with agency regulations.\n\n(iii) The following should not be included in the subcontracting base: internally generated costs such as salaries and wages; employee insurance; other employee benefits; payments for petty cash; depreciation; interest; income taxes; property taxes; lease payments; fines, claims, and dues; Original Equipment Manufacturer relationships during warranty periods (negotiated up front with product); utilities such as electricity, water, sewer, and other services purchased from a municipality or solely authorized by the municipality to provide those services in a particular geographical region; and philanthropic contributions. Utility companies may be eligible for additional exclusions unique to their industry, which may be approved by the contracting officer on a case-by-case basis. Exclusions from the subcontracting base include but are not limited to those listed above.\n\n(2) Subcontracting goals required under paragraph (c) of this section must be established in terms of the total dollars subcontracted and as a percentage of total subcontract dollars. However, a contracting officer may establish additional goals as a percentage of total contract dollars.\n\n(3) A prime contractor has a history of unjustified untimely or reduced payments to subcontractors if the prime contractor has reported itself to a contracting officer in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this section on three occasions within a 12 month period.\n\n(4) For subcontracting purposes, a concern must qualify as a small business concern and a socioeconomic small business concern as of the date that it certifies that it is small or that it qualifies as a socioeconomic small business concern for the subcontract.\n\n(b) Responsibilities of prime contractors. (1) Prime contractors (including small business prime contractors) selected to receive a Federal contract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold, that will not be performed entirely outside of any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and that is not for services which are personal in nature, are responsible for ensuring that small business concerns have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in the performance of the contract, including subcontracts for subsystems, assemblies, components, and related services for major systems, consistent with the efficient performance of the contract.\n\n(2) A small business cannot be required to submit a formal subcontracting plan or be asked to submit a formal subcontracting plan, a small-business prime contractor is encouraged to provide maximum practicable opportunity to other small businesses to participate in the performance of the contract, consistent with the efficient performance of the contract. This applies whether the firm qualifies as a small business concern for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract, or is deemed to be treated as a small business concern by statute (see e.g., 43 U.S.C. 1626(e)(4)(B)).\n\n(3) Efforts to provide the maximum practicable subcontracting opportunities for small business concern may include, as appropriate for the procurement, one or more of the following actions:\n\n(i) Breaking out contract work items into economically feasible units, as appropriate, to facilitate small business participation;\n\n(ii) Conducting market research to identify small business subcontractors and suppliers through all reasonable means, such as performing online searches via the System for Award Management (SAM) (or any successor system), posting Notices of Sources Sought and/or Requests for Proposal on SBA's SUB-Net, participating in Business Matchmaking events, and attending pre-bid conferences;\n\n(iii) Soliciting small business concerns as early in the acquisition process as practicable to allow them sufficient time to submit a timely offer for the subcontract;\n\n(iv) Providing interested small businesses with adequate and timely information about the plans, specifications, and requirements for performance of the prime contract to assist them in submitting a timely offer for the subcontract;\n\n(v) Negotiating in good faith with interested small businesses;\n\n(vi) Directing small businesses that need additional assistance to SBA;\n\n(vii) Assisting interested small businesses in obtaining bonding, lines of credit, required insurance, necessary equipment, supplies, materials, or services;\n\n(viii) Utilizing the available services of small business associations; local, state, and Federal small business assistance offices; and other organizations; and\n\n(ix) Participating in a formal mentor-protégé program with one or more small-business protégés that results in developmental assistance to the protégés.\n\n(4) Except for HUBZone and SDVO small business subcontractors, a prime contractor may rely on the socioeconomic self-certification of a subcontractor provided the prime contractor does not have a reason to doubt the subcontractor's self-certification.\n\n(c) Additional responsibilities of other than small contractors. (1) In addition to the responsibilities provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a prime contractor selected for award of a contract or contract modification that exceeds $750,000, or $1,500,000 in the case of construction of a public facility, is responsible for the following:\n\n(i) Submitting and negotiating before award an acceptable subcontracting plan that reflects maximum practicable opportunities for small businesses in the performance of the contract as subcontractors or suppliers at all tiers of performance. A prime contractor may submit a commercial plan, described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, instead of an individual subcontracting plan, when the product or service being furnished to the Government meets the definition of a commercial product or commercial service under 48 CFR 2.101;\n\n(ii) Making a good-faith effort to achieve the dollar and percentage goals and other elements in its subcontracting plan;\n\n(iii) The contractor may not prohibit a subcontractor from discussing any material matter pertaining to payment or utilization with the contracting officer;\n\n(iv) When developing an individual subcontracting plan (also called individual contract plan), the contractor must determine whether to include indirect costs in its subcontracting goals. A prime contractor must include indirect costs in its subcontracting goals if the contract exceeds $7.5 million. Below $7.5 million, a prime contractor may include indirect costs in its subcontracting plan at its option. If indirect costs are included in the goals, these costs must be included in the Individual Subcontract Report (ISR) in www.esrs.gov (eSRS) or Subcontract Reports for Individual Contracts (the paper SF-294, if authorized). Contractors may use a pro rata formula to allocate indirect costs to covered individual contracts, if the indirect costs are not already allocable to specific contracts. Regardless of whether the contractor has included indirect costs in the subcontracting plan, indirect costs must be included on a prorated basis in the Summary Subcontracting Report (SSR) in the eSRS system. A contractor authorized to use a commercial subcontracting plan must include all indirect costs in its subcontracting goals and in its SSR;\n\n(v) The contractor must assign to each subcontract, and to each solicitation, if a solicitation is utilized, the NAICS code and corresponding size standard that best describes the principal purpose of the subcontract (see § 121.410 of this chapter). A formal solicitation is not required for each subcontract, but the contractor must provide some form of written notice of the NAICS code and size standard assigned to potential offerors prior to acceptance and award of the subcontract. The prime contractor (or subcontractor) may rely on a subcontractor's electronic representations and certifications, if the solicitation for the subcontract contains a clause which provides that the subcontractor verifies by submission of the offer that the size or socioeconomic representations and certifications are current, accurate and complete as of the date of the offer for the subcontract. Electronic submission may include any method acceptable to the prime contractor (or subcontractor) including, but not limited to, size or socioeconomic representations and certifications made in SAM (or any successor system). A prime contractor (or subcontractor) may not require the use of SAM (or any successor system) for purposes of representing size or socioeconomic status in connection with a subcontract;\n\n(vi) The contractor must submit timely and accurate ISRs and SSRs in eSRS (or any successor system), or if information for a particular procurement cannot be entered into eSRS (or any successor system), submit a timely SF-294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contract. When a report is rejected by the contracting officer, the contractor must make the necessary corrections and resubmit the report within 30 days of receiving the notice of rejection;\n\n(vii) The contractor must cooperate in the reviews of subcontracting plan compliance, including providing requested information and supporting documentation reflecting actual achievements and good-faith efforts to meet the goals and other elements in the subcontracting plan;\n\n(viii) The contractor must provide pre-award written notification to unsuccessful small business offerors on all competitive subcontracts over the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101). The written notification must include the name and location of the apparent successful offeror and if the successful offeror is a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business;\n\n(ix) As a best practice, the contractor may provide the pre-award written notification cited in paragraph (c)(1)(viii) of this section to unsuccessful and small business offerors on subcontracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101) and should do so whenever practical;\n\n(x) Except when subcontracting for commercial products or commercial services, the prime contractor must require all subcontractors (except small business concerns) who receive subcontracts in excess of $1,500,000 in the case of a subcontract for the construction of any public facility, or in excess of $750,000 in the case of all other subcontracts, and which offer further subcontracting possibilities, to adopt a subcontracting plan of their own consistent with this section, and must ensure at a minimum that all subcontractors required to maintain subcontracting plans pursuant to this paragraph will review and approve subcontracting plans submitted by their subcontractors; monitor their subcontractors' compliance with their approved subcontracting plans; ensure that subcontracting reports are submitted by their subcontractors when required; acknowledge receipt of their subcontractors' reports; compare the performance of their subcontractors to their subcontracting plans and goals; and discuss performance with their subcontractors when necessary to ensure their subcontractors make a good-faith effort to comply with their subcontracting plans;\n\n(xi) The prime contractor must provide a written statement of the types of records it will maintain to demonstrate procedures which have been adopted to ensure subcontractors at all tiers comply with the requirements and goals set forth in the subcontracting plan established in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(x) of this section, including the establishment of source lists of small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans, certified small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, certified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women; the efforts to identify and award subcontracts to such small business concerns; and size or socioeconomic certifications or representations received in connection with each subcontract;\n\n(xii) The prime contractor must provide a written statement of the types of records it will maintain to demonstrate that procedures have been adopted to substantiate the subcontracting credit that the prime contractor elects under paragraph (a)(1)(i)(C) of this section; and\n\n(xiii)(A) The prime contractor, upon request from a first-tier small business subcontractor, shall provide the subcontractor with a rating of the subcontractor's past performance. The prime contractor must provide the small business subcontractor the requested rating within 15 calendar days of the request. The rating provided by the prime contractor to the first-tier small business subcontractor shall utilize the five-scale ratings system found in FAR 42.1503 (48 CFR 42.1503): Exceptional, Very Good, Satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory. If the subcontractor will use the rating for an offer on a prime contract, it must include, at a minimum, the following evaluation factors in the requested rating:\n\n(1) Technical (quality of product or service);\n\n(2) Cost control (not applicable for firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment arrangements);\n\n(3) Schedule/timeliness;\n\n(4) Management or business relations; and\n\n(5) Other (as applicable).\n\n(B) The requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(xii)(A) of this section is not subject to the flow-down in paragraph (c)(1)(x) of this section.\n\n(C) A first-tier small business subcontractor must make the request for a performance rating from the prime contractor within 30 calendar days after the completion of the period of performance for the prime contractor's contract with the Government. The prime contractor and the first-tier small business subcontractor may negotiate a later deadline for the request for a performance rating, but in no case can the prime contractor impose a deadline earlier than 30 calendar days after the completion of the period of performance for the prime contractor's contract with the Government.\n\n(D) The rating provided by the prime contractor to the first-tier small business subcontractor shall utilize the five-scale ratings system found in FAR 42.1503 (48 CFR 42.1503): Exceptional, Very Good, Satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory.\n\n(2) A commercial plan, also referred to as an annual plan or company-wide plan, is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing commercial products and commercial services. A commercial plan covers the offeror's fiscal year and applies to all of the commercial products and commercial services sold by either the entire company or a portion thereof (e.g., division, plant, or product line). Once approved, the plan remains in effect during the federal fiscal year for all Federal Government contracts in effect during that period. The contracting officer of the agency that originally approved the commercial plan will exercise the functions of the contracting officer on behalf of all agencies that award contracts covered by the plan.\n\n(3) An offeror must represent to the contracting officer that it will make a good faith effort to acquire articles, equipment, supplies, services, or materials, or obtain the performance of construction work from the small business concerns that it used in preparing the bid or proposal, in the same scope, amount, and quality used in preparing and submitting the bid or proposal. Merely responding to a request for a quote does not constitute use in preparing a bid or offer. An offeror used a small business concern in preparing the bid or proposal if:\n\n(i) The offeror references the small business concern as a subcontractor in the bid or proposal or associated small business subcontracting plan;\n\n(ii) The offeror has a subcontract or agreement in principle to subcontract with the small business concern to perform a portion of the specific contract; or\n\n(iii) The small business concern drafted any portion of the bid or proposal or the offeror used the small business concern's pricing or cost information or technical expertise in preparing the bid or proposal, where there is written evidence (including email) of an intent or understanding that the small business concern will be awarded a subcontract for the related work if the offeror is awarded the contract.\n\n(4) If a prime contractor fails to acquire articles, equipment, supplies, services or materials or obtain the performance of construction work as described in (c)(3), the prime contractor must provide the contracting officer with a written explanation. This written explanation must be submitted to the contracting officer prior to the submission of the invoice for final payment and contract close-out.\n\n(5) A prime contractor shall notify the contracting officer in writing if upon completion of the responsibilities of the small business subcontractor (i.e., the subcontractor is entitled to payment under the terms of the subcontract), the prime contractor pays a reduced price to a small business subcontractor for goods and services provided for the contract or the payment to a small business subcontractor is more than 90 days past due under the terms of the subcontract for goods and services provided for the contract and for which the Federal agency has paid the prime contractor. “Reduced price” means a price that is less than the price agreed upon in a written, binding contractual document. The prime contractor shall include the reason for the reduction in payment to or failure to pay a small business subcontractor in any written notice.\n\n(6) If at the conclusion of a contract the prime contractor did not meet all of the small business subcontracting goals in the subcontracting plan, the prime contractor shall provide the contracting officer with a written explanation as to why it did not meet the goals of the plan so that the contracting officer can evaluate whether the prime contractor acted in good faith as set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.\n\n(7) The additional prime contractor responsibilities described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply if:\n\n(i) The prime contractor is a small business concern;\n\n(ii) The prime contract or contract modification is a personal services contract; or\n\n(iii) The prime contract or contract modification will be performed entirely outside of any state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n(8) A prime contractor that identifies a small business by name as a subcontractor in a proposal, offer, bid or subcontracting plan must notify those subcontractors in writing prior to identifying the concern in the proposal, bid, offer or subcontracting plan.\n\n(9) Anyone who has a reasonable basis to believe that a prime contractor or a subcontractor may have made a false statement to an employee or representative of the Federal Government, or to an employee or representative of the prime contractor, with respect to subcontracting plans must report the matter to the SBA Office of Inspector General. All other concerns as to whether a prime contractor or subcontractor has complied with SBA regulations or otherwise acted in bad faith may be reported to the Government Contracting Area Office where the firm is headquartered.\n\n(d) Contracting officer responsibilities. The contracting officer (or administrative contracting officer if specifically delegated in writing to accomplish this task) is responsible for evaluating the prime contractor's compliance with its subcontracting plan, including:\n\n(1) Ensuring that all contractors submit their subcontracting reports into the eSRS (or any successor system) or, if applicable, the SF-294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts, within 45 days after the report ending date (e.g., by November 14th for the fiscal year ended September 30th).\n\n(2) Reviewing all ISRs, and where applicable, SSRs, in eSRS (or any successor system) within 75 days of the report ending date (e.g., by December 14th for a report submitted for the fiscal year ended September 30th) and either accepting or rejecting the reports in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions set forth in 48 CFR subpart 19.7, 52.219-9, and the eSRS instructions (www.esrs.gov). The authority to acknowledge or reject SSRs for commercial plans resides with the contracting officer who approved the commercial plan. If a report is rejected, the contracting officer must provide an explanation for the rejection to allow prime contractors the opportunity to respond specifically to perceived deficiencies.\n\n(3) Evaluating whether the prime contractor made a good faith effort to comply with its small business subcontracting plan.\n\n(i) Evidence that a large business prime contractor has made a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan or other subcontracting responsibilities includes supporting documentation that:\n\n(A) The contractor performed one or more of the actions described in paragraph (b) of this section, as appropriate for the procurement;\n\n(B) Although the contractor may have failed to achieve its goal in one socioeconomic category, it over-achieved its goal by an equal or greater amount in one or more of the other categories; or\n\n(C) The contractor fulfilled all of the requirements of its subcontracting plan.\n\n(ii) Examples of activities reflective of a failure to make a good faith effort to comply with a subcontracting plan include, but are not limited, to:\n\n(A) Failure to submit the acceptable individual or summary subcontracting reports in eSRS by the report due dates or as provided by other agency regulations within prescribed time frames;\n\n(B) Failure to pay small business concern subcontractors in accordance with the terms of the contract with the prime;\n\n(C) Failure to designate and maintain a company official to administer the subcontracting program and monitor and enforce compliance with the plan;\n\n(D) Failure to maintain records or otherwise demonstrate procedures adopted to comply with the plan including subcontracting flow-down requirements;\n\n(E) Adoption of company policies or documented procedures that have as their objectives the frustration of the objectives of the plan;\n\n(F) Failure to correct substantiated findings from federal subcontracting compliance reviews or participate in subcontracting plan management training offered by the government;\n\n(G) Failure to conduct market research identifying potential small business concern subcontractors through all reasonable means including outreach, industry days, or the use of federal database marketing systems such as SBA's Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS) or SUBNet Systems or any successor federal systems;\n\n(H) Failure to comply with regulations requiring submission of a written explanation to the contracting officer to change small business concern subcontractors that were used in preparing offers; or\n\n(I) Falsifying records of subcontracting awards to SBCs.\n\n(4) Evaluating the prime contractor's written explanation concerning the prime contractor's failure to use a small business concern in performance in the same scope, amount, and quality used in preparing and submitting the bid or proposal, and considering that information when rating the contractor for past performance purposes.\n\n(5) Evaluating the prime contractor's written explanation concerning its payment of a reduced price to a small business subcontractor for goods and services upon completion of the responsibilities of the subcontractor or its payment to a subcontractor more than 90 days past due under the terms of the subcontract for goods and services provided for the contract and for which the Federal agency has paid the prime contractor, and considering that information when rating the contractor for past performance purposes.\n\n(6) Evaluating whether the prime contractor has a history of unjustified untimely or reduced payments to subcontractors, and if so, recording the identity of the prime contractor in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), or any successor database.\n\n(7) In his or her discretion, requiring the prime contractor (other than a prime contractor with a commercial plan) to update its subcontracting plan when an option is exercised.\n\n(8) Requiring the prime contractor (other than a contractor with a commercial plan) to submit a subcontracting plan if the value of a modification causes the value of the contract to exceed the subcontracting plan threshold and to the extent that subcontracting opportunities exist.\n\n(9) In his or her discretion, requiring a subcontracting plan if a prime contractor's size status changes from small to other than small as a result of a size recertification.\n\n(10) Where a subcontracting plan is amended in connection with an option, or added as a result of a recertification or modification, the changes to any existing plan are for prospective subcontracting opportunities and do not apply retroactively. However, since achievements must be reported on the ISR (or the SF-294, if applicable) on a cumulative basis from the inception of the contract, the contractor's achievements prior to the modification or option will be factored into its overall achievement on the contract from inception.\n\n(11) Evaluating whether the contractor or subcontractor complied in good faith with the requirement to provide periodic reports and cooperate in any studies or surveys as may be required by the Federal agency or the Administration in order to determine the extent of compliance by the contractor or subcontractor with the subcontracting plan. The contractor or subcontractor's failure to comply with this requirement in good faith shall be a material breach of such contract or subcontract and may be considered in any past performance evaluation of the contractor.\n\n(e) CMR Responsibilities. Commercial Market Representatives (CMRs) are SBA's subcontracting specialists. CMRs are responsible for:\n\n(1) Facilitating the matching of large prime contractors with small business concerns;\n\n(2) Counseling large prime contractors on their responsibilities to maximize subcontracting opportunities for small business concerns;\n\n(3) Instructing large prime contractors on identifying small business concerns by means of SAM (or any successor system), SUB-Net, Business Matchmaking events, and other resources and tools;\n\n(4) Counseling small business concerns on how to market themselves to large prime contractors;\n\n(5) Maintaining a portfolio of large prime contractors and conducting Subcontracting Orientation and Assistance Reviews (SOARs). SOARs are conducted for the purpose of assisting prime contractors in understanding and complying with their small business subcontracting responsibilities, including developing subcontracting goals that reflect maximum practicable opportunity for small business; maintaining acceptable books and records; and periodically submitting reports to the Federal government; and\n\n(6) Conducting periodic reviews, including compliance reviews in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.\n\n(f) Compliance reviews. (1) A prime contractor's performance under its subcontracting plan is evaluated by means of on-site compliance reviews and follow-up reviews, as a supplement to evaluations performed by the contracting agency, either on a contract-by-contract basis or, in the case of contractors having multiple contracts, on an aggregate basis. A compliance review is a surveillance review that determines a contractor's achievements in meeting the goals and other elements in its subcontracting plan for both open contracts and contracts completed during the previous twelve months. A follow-up review is done after a compliance review, generally within six to eight months, to determine if the contractor has implemented SBA's recommendations.\n\n(2) All compliance reviews begin with a validation of the prime contractor's most recent ISR (or SF-294, if applicable) or SSR. A compliance review includes:\n\n(i) An evaluation of whether the prime contractor assigned the proper NAICS code and corresponding size standard to a subcontract, and a review of whether small business subcontractors qualify for the size or socioeconomic status claimed;\n\n(ii) Validation of the prime contractor's methodology for completing its subcontracting reports; and\n\n(iii) Consideration of whether the prime contractor is monitoring its other than small subcontractors with regard to their subcontracting plans, determining achievement of their proposed subcontracting goals, and reviewing their subcontractors' ISRs (or SF-294s, if applicable).\n\n(3) Upon completion of the review and evaluation of a contractor's performance and efforts to achieve the requirements in its subcontracting plans, the contractor's performance will be assigned one of the following ratings: Exceptional, Very Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. The factors listed in paragraph (c) of this section will be taken into consideration, where applicable, in determining the contractor's rating. However, a contractor may be found Unsatisfactory, regardless of other factors, if it cannot substantiate the claimed achievements under its subcontracting plan.\n\n(4) Any contractor that receives a marginal or unsatisfactory rating must provide a written corrective action plan to SBA, or to both SBA and the agency that conducted the compliance review if the agency conducting the review has an agreement with SBA, within 30 days of its receipt of the official compliance report.\n\n(5) Any contractor that fails to comply with paragraph (f)(4) of this section, or any contractor that fails to demonstrate a good-faith effort, as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section:\n\n(i) May be considered for liquidated damages under the procedures in 48 CFR 19.705-7 and the clause at 52.219-16; and\n\n(ii) Shall be in material breach of such contract or subcontract, and such failure to demonstrate good faith must be considered in any past performance evaluation of the contractor. This action shall be considered by the contracting officer upon receipt of a written recommendation to that effect from the CMR. The CMR's recommendation must include a copy of the compliance report and any other relevant correspondence or supporting documentation. Furthermore, if the CMR has a reasonable basis to believe that a contractor has made a false statement to an employee or representative of the Federal Government, or to an employee or representative of the prime contractor, the CMR must report the matter to the SBA Office of Inspector General. All other concerns as to whether a prime contractor or subcontractor has complied with SBA regulations or otherwise acted in bad faith may be reported to the Area Government Contracting Office where the firm is headquartered.\n\n(6) Reviews and evaluations of contractors with commercial plans are identical to reviews and evaluations of other contractors, except that contractors with commercial subcontracting plans do not submit the SF-294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts. Instead, goal achievement is determined by comparing the goals in the approved commercial subcontracting plan against the cumulative achievements on the SF-295, Summary Subcontract Report, for the same period. The same ratings criteria set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section apply to contractors with commercial plans.\n\n(7) SBA is authorized to enter into agreements with other Federal agencies or entities to conduct compliance reviews and otherwise further the objectives of the subcontracting program. Copies of these agreements will be published on http://www.sba.gov/GC. SBA is the lead agency on all joint compliance reviews with other agencies.\n\n(8) The head of the contracting agency shall ensure that:\n\n(i) The agency collects and reports data on the extent to which contractors of the agency meet the goals and objectives set forth in subcontracting plans; and\n\n(ii) The agency periodically reviews data collected and reported pursuant to paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section for the purpose of ensuring that such contractors comply in good faith with the requirements of this section.\n\n(g) Subcontracting consideration in source selection. (1) A contracting officer may include an evaluation factor in a solicitation which evaluates:\n\n(i) An offeror's proposed approach to small business subcontracting participation in the subject procurement;\n\n(ii) The extent to which the offeror has met its small business subcontracting plan goals on previous covered contracts; and/or\n\n(iii) The extent to which the offeror timely paid its small business subcontractors under covered contracts.\n\n(2) A contracting officer may include an evaluation factor in a solicitation which evaluates an offeror's commitment to pay small business subcontractors within a specific number of days after receipt of payment from the Government for goods and services previously rendered by the small business subcontractor.\n\n(i) The contracting officer will comparatively evaluate the proposed timelines.\n\n(ii) Such a commitment shall become a material part of the contract.\n\n(iii) The contracting officer must consider the contractor's compliance with the commitment in evaluating performance, including for purposes of contract continuation (such as exercising options).\n\n(3) A small business concern submitting an offer shall receive the maximum score, credit or rating under an evaluation factor described in paragraph (g) of this section without having to submit any information in connection with this factor.\n\n(4) A contracting officer shall include a significant evaluation factor for the criteria described in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (g)(1)(ii) of this section in a bundled contract or order as defined in § 125.2.\n\n(5) Paragraph (g) of this section may apply to solicitations for orders against multiple award contracts, (including a Federal Supply Schedule or Multiple Award Schedule contract, a Government-wide acquisition contract (GWAC), or a multi-agency contract (MAC)), blanket purchase agreements or basic ordering agreements.\n\n(h) Multiple award contracts. (1) Except where a prime contractor has a commercial plan, the contracting officer shall require a subcontracting plan for each multiple award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract (including Multiple Award Schedule), where the estimated value of the contract exceeds the subcontracting plan thresholds in paragraph (a) of this section and the contract has subcontracting opportunities.\n\n(2) Contractors shall submit small business subcontracting reports for individual orders to the contracting agency on an annual basis.\n\n(3) The agency funding the order shall receive credit towards its small business subcontracting goals. More than one agency may not receive credit towards its subcontracting goals for a particular subcontract.\n\n(4) The agency funding the order may in its discretion establish small business subcontracting goals for individual orders, blanket purchase agreements or basic ordering agreements.\n\n(i) Subcontracting consideration in bundled and consolidated contracts. (1) For bundled requirements, the agency must evaluate offers from teams of small businesses the same as other offers, with due consideration to the capabilities of all proposed subcontractors.\n\n(2) For substantial bundling, the agency must design actions to maximize small business participation as subcontractors (including suppliers) at any tier under the contract or contracts that may be awarded to meet the requirements.\n\n(3) For significant subcontracting opportunities in consolidated contracts, bundled requirements, and substantially bundled requirements, see § 125.2(d)(4).\n\n[69 FR 75824, Dec. 20, 2004, as amended at 74 FR 46887, Sept. 14, 2009; 78 FR 42403, July 16, 2013; 78 FR 59798, Sept. 30, 2013; 78 FR 61142, Oct. 2, 2013; 81 FR 34262, May 31, 2016; 81 FR 94250, Dec. 23, 2016; 83 FR 12852, Mar. 26, 2018; 84 FR 65239, Nov. 26, 2019; 84 FR 65663, Nov. 29, 2019; 85 FR 66192, Oct. 16, 2020; 86 FR 61672, Nov. 8, 2021; 87 FR 43739, July 22, 2022; 88 FR 26210, Apr. 27, 2023; 88 FR 70343, Oct. 11, 2023; 89 FR 48269, June 6, 2024; 89 FR 102491, Dec. 17, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. (1) The Certificate of Competency (COC) Program is authorized under section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(b)(7)). The COC Program is applicable to all Government procurement actions, with the exception of 8(a) sole source awards but including Multiple Award Contracts and orders placed against Multiple Award Contracts, where the contracting officer has used any issues of capacity or credit (responsibility) to determine suitability for an award. The COC Program is applicable to all Government procurement actions, including Multiple Award Contracts and orders placed against Multiple Award Contracts, where the contracting officer has used any issues of capacity or credit (responsibility) to determine suitability for an award. With respect to Multiple Award Contracts, contracting officers generally determine responsibility at the time of award of the contract. However, if a contracting officer makes a responsibility determination as set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for an order issued against a Multiple Award Contract, the contracting officer must refer the matter to SBA for a COC. The COC procedures apply to all Federal procurements, regardless of the location of performance or the location of the procuring activity.\n\n(2) A contracting officer must refer a small business concern to SBA for a possible COC, even if the next apparent successful offeror is also a small business, when the contracting officer:\n\n(i) Denies an apparent successful small business offeror award of a contract or order on the basis of responsibility (including those bases set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section);\n\n(ii) Refuses to consider a small business concern for award of a contract or order after evaluating the concern's offer on a non-comparative basis (e.g., a pass/fail, go/no go, or acceptable/unacceptable) under one or more responsibility type evaluation factors (such as experience of the company or key personnel or past performance); or\n\n(iii) Refuses to consider a small business concern for award of a contract or order because it failed to meet a definitive responsibility criterion contained in the solicitation.\n\n(3) A small business offeror referred to SBA as nonresponsible may apply to SBA for a COC. Where the applicant is a non-manufacturing offeror on a supply contract, the COC applies to the responsibility of the non-manufacturer, not to that of the manufacturer.\n\n(b) COC Eligibility. (1) The offeror seeking a COC has the burden of proof to demonstrate its eligibility for COC review. (i) To be eligible for a COC, an offeror must qualify as a small business under the applicable size standard in accordance with part 121 of this chapter.\n\n(ii) To be eligible for a COC, an offeror must qualify as a small business under the applicable size standard in accordance with part 121 of this chapter, and must have agreed to comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule, where applicable.\n\n(2) SBA will determine a concern ineligible for a COC if the concern, or any of its principals, appears in the “Parties Excluded From Federal Procurement Programs” section found in the U.S. General Services Administration Office of Acquisition Policy Publication: List of Parties Excluded From Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs. If a principal is unable to presently control the applicant concern, and appears in the Procurement section of the list due to matters not directly related to the concern itself, responsibility will be determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section.\n\n(3) An eligibility determination will be made on a case-by-case basis, where a concern or any of its principals appears in the Nonprocurement Section of the publication referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.\n\n(c) Referral of nonresponsibility determination to SBA. (1) The contracting officer must refer the matter in writing to the SBA Government Contracting Area Office (Area Office) serving the area in which the headquarters of the offeror is located. The referral must include a copy of the following:\n\n(i) Solicitation;\n\n(ii) Offer submitted by the concern whose responsibility is at issue for the procurement (its Best and Final Offer for a negotiated procurement);\n\n(iii) Abstract of Bids, where applicable, or the Contracting Officer's Price Negotiation Memorandum;\n\n(iv) Preaward survey, where applicable;\n\n(v) Contracting officer's written determination of nonresponsibility;\n\n(vi) Technical data package (including drawings, specifications, and Statement of Work); and\n\n(vii) Any other justification and documentation used to arrive at the nonresponsibility determination.\n\n(2) Contract award must be withheld by the contracting officer for a period of 15 working days (or longer if agreed to by SBA and the contracting officer) following receipt by the appropriate Area Office of a referral which includes all required documentation.\n\n(3) The COC referral must indicate that the offeror has been found responsive to the solicitation, and also identify the reasons for the nonresponsibility determination.\n\n(d) Application for COC. (1) Upon receipt of the contracting officer's referral, the Area Office will inform the concern of the contracting officer's negative responsibility determination, and offer it the opportunity to apply to SBA for a COC by a specified date.\n\n(2) The COC application must include all information and documentation requested by SBA and any additional information which the firm believes will demonstrate its ability to perform on the proposed contract. The application should be returned as soon as possible, but no later than the date specified by SBA.\n\n(3) Upon receipt of a complete and acceptable application, SBA may elect to visit the applicant's facility to review its responsibility. SBA personnel may obtain clarification or confirmation of information provided by the applicant by directly contacting suppliers, financial institutions, and other third parties upon whom the applicant's responsibility depends.\n\n(e) Incomplete applications. If an application for a COC is materially incomplete or is not submitted by the date specified by SBA, SBA will close the case without issuing a COC and will notify the contracting officer and the concern with a declination letter.\n\n(f) Reviewing an application. (1) The COC review process is not limited to the areas of nonresponsibility cited by the contracting officer. SBA may, at its discretion, independently evaluate the COC applicant for all elements of responsibility, but it may presume responsibility exists as to elements other than those cited as deficient. SBA may deny a COC for reasons of nonresponsibility not originally cited by the contracting officer.\n\n(2) An offeror seeking a COC has the burden of proof to demonstrate that it possesses all relevant elements of responsibility and that it has overcome the contracting officer's objection(s).\n\n(3) A small business will be rebuttably presumed nonresponsible if any of the following circumstances are shown to exist:\n\n(i) Within three years before the application for a COC, the concern, or any of its principals, has been convicted of an offense or offenses that would constitute grounds for debarment or suspension under FAR subpart 9.4 (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4), and the matter is still under the jurisdiction of a court (e.g., the principals of a concern are incarcerated, on probation or parole, or under a suspended sentence); or\n\n(ii) Within three years before the application for a COC, the concern or any of its principals has had a civil judgment entered against it or them for any reason that would constitute grounds for debarment or suspension under FAR subpart 9.4 (48 CFR part, subpart 9.4).\n\n(4) Where a contracting officer finds a concern to be non-responsible for reasons of financial capacity on an indefinite delivery or indefinite quantity task or delivery order contract, the Area Director will consider the firm's maximum financial capacity. If the Area Director issues a COC, it will be for a specific amount that is the limit of the firm's financial capacity for that contract. The contracting officer may subsequently determine to exceed the amount, but cannot deny the firm award of an order or contract on financial grounds if the firm has not reached the financial maximum the Area Director identified in the COC letter.\n\n(g) Decision by Area Director (“Director”). After reviewing the information submitted by the applicant and the information gathered by SBA, the Area Director will make a determination, either final or recommended as set forth in the following chart:\n\n(h) Notification of intent to issue on a contract or order with a value between the simplified acquisition threshold and $25 million. Where the Director determines that a COC is warranted, he or she will notify the contracting officer (or the procurement official with the authority to accept SBA's decision) of the intent to issue a COC, and of the reasons for that decision, prior to issuing the COC. At the time of notification, the contracting officer or the procurement official with the authority to accept SBA's decision has the following options:\n\n(1) Accept the Director's decision to issue the COC and award the contract to the concern. The COC issuance letter will then be sent, including as an attachment a detailed rationale of the decision; or\n\n(2) Ask the Director to suspend the case for one of the following purposes:\n\n(i) To forward a detailed rationale for the decision to the contracting officer for review within a specified period of time;\n\n(ii) To afford the contracting officer the opportunity to meet with the Area Office to review all documentation contained in the case file;\n\n(iii) To submit any information which the contracting officer believes SBA has not considered (at which time, SBA will establish a new suspense date mutually agreeable to the contracting officer and SBA); or\n\n(iv) To permit resolution of an appeal by the contracting agency to SBA Headquarters under paragraph (i) of this section.\n\n(i) Appeals of Area Director determinations. For COC actions with a value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold , contracting agencies may appeal a Director's decision to issue a COC to SBA Headquarters by filing an appeal with the Area Office processing the COC application. The Area Office must honor the request to appeal if the contracting officer agrees to withhold award until the appeal process is concluded. Without such an agreement from the contracting officer, the Director must issue the COC. When such an agreement has been obtained, the Area Office will immediately forward the case file to SBA Headquarters.\n\n(1) The intent of the appeal procedure is to allow the contracting agency the opportunity to submit to SBA Headquarters any documentation which the Area Office may not have considered.\n\n(2) SBA Headquarters will furnish written notice to the Director, OSDBU or OSBP of the procuring agency, with a copy to the contracting officer, that the case file has been received and that an appeal decision may be requested by an authorized official. If the contracting agency decides to file an appeal, it must notify SBA Headquarters through its Director, OSDBU, within 10 working days (or a time period agreed upon by both agencies) of its receipt of the notice under paragraph (h) of this section. The appeal and any supporting documentation must be filed within 10 working days (or a different time period agreed to by both agencies) after SBA receives the request for a formal appeal.\n\n(3) The SBA Director, Office of Government Contracting (D/GC) will make a final determination, in writing, to issue or to deny the COC.\n\n(j) Decision by SBA Headquarters where contract value exceeds $25 million. (1) Prior to taking final action, SBA Headquarters will contact the contracting agency at the secretariat level or agency equivalent and afford it the following options:\n\n(i) Ask SBA Headquarters to suspend the case so that the agency can meet with Headquarters personnel and review all documentation contained in the case file; or\n\n(ii) Submit to SBA Headquarters for evaluation any information which the contracting agency believes has not been considered.\n\n(2) After reviewing all available information, the AA/GC will make a final decision to either issue or deny the COC. If the AA/GC's decision is to deny the COC, the applicant and contracting agency will be informed in writing by the Area Office. If the decision is to issue the COC, a letter certifying the responsibility of the firm will be sent to the contracting agency by Headquarters and the applicant will be informed of such issuance by the Area Office. Except as set forth in paragraph (l) of this section, there can be no further appeal or reconsideration of the decision of the AA/GC.\n\n(k) Notification of denial of COC. The notification to an unsuccessful applicant following either an Area Director or a Headquarters denial of a COC will briefly state all reasons for denial and inform the applicant that a meeting may be requested with appropriate SBA personnel to discuss the denial. Upon receipt of a request for such a meeting, the appropriate SBA personnel will confer with the applicant and explain the reasons for SBA's action. The meeting does not constitute an opportunity to rebut the merits of the SBA's decision to deny the COC, and is for the sole purpose of giving the applicant the opportunity to correct deficiencies so as to improve its ability to obtain future contracts either directly or, if necessary, through the issuance of a COC.\n\n(l) Reconsideration of COC after issuance. (1) An approved COC may be reconsidered and possibly rescinded, at the sole discretion of SBA, where an award of the contract has not occurred, and one of the following circumstances exists:\n\n(i) The COC applicant submitted false or omitted materially adverse information;\n\n(ii) New materially adverse information has been received relating to the current responsibility of the applicant concern; or\n\n(iii) The COC has been issued for more than 60 days (in which case SBA may investigate the business concern's current circumstances and the reason why the contract has not been issued).\n\n(2) Where SBA reconsiders and reaffirms the COC the procedures under paragraph (h) of this section do not apply.\n\n(m) Effect of a COC. By the terms of the Act, a COC is conclusive as to responsibility. Where SBA issues a COC on behalf of a small business with respect to a particular contract, contracting officers are required to award the contract without requiring the firm to meet any other requirement with respect to responsibility. Where SBA issues a COC with respect to a referral in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) or (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the contracting officer is not required to issue an award to that offeror if the contracting officer denies the contract for reasons unrelated to responsibility.\n\n(n) Effect of Denial of COC. Denial of a COC by SBA does not preclude a contracting officer from awarding a contract to the referred firm, nor does it prevent the concern from making an offer on any other procurement.\n\n(o) Monitoring performance. Once a COC has been issued and a contract awarded on that basis, SBA will monitor contractor performance.\n\n[61 FR 3312, Jan. 31, 1996; 61 FR 7987, Mar. 1, 1996, as amended at 72 FR 50041, Aug. 30, 2007; 78 FR 61142, Oct. 2, 2013; 81 FR 34262, May 31, 2016; 81 FR 48585, July 25, 2016; 85 FR 66192, Oct. 16, 2020]",

    "content": "(a) General. In order to be awarded a full or partial small business set-aside contract with a value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101), an 8(a) contract, an SDVOSB contract, a VOSB contract, a HUBZone contract, or a WOSB or EDWOSB contract pursuant to part 127 of this chapter, a small business concern must agree that:\n\n(1) In the case of a contract for services (except construction), it will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not similarly situated. Any work that a similarly situated subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the 50% subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. Other direct costs may be excluded to the extent they are not the principal purpose of the acquisition and small business concerns do not provide the service, such as airline travel, work performed by a transportation or disposal entity under a contract assigned the environmental remediation NAICS code (562910), cloud computing services, or mass media purchases. In addition, work performed overseas on awards made pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or work required to be performed by a local contractor, is excluded.\n\n(2)(i) In the case of a contract for supplies or products (other than from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies), it will not pay more than 50% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not similarly situated. Any work that a similarly situated subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the 50% subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. Cost of materials are excluded and not considered to be subcontracted.\n\n(ii) In the case of a contract for supplies from a nonmanufacturer, it will supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer or processor, unless a waiver as described in § 121.406(b)(5) of this chapter is granted.\n\n(A) For a multiple item procurement where a waiver as described in § 121.406(b)(5) of this chapter has not been granted for one or more items, more than 50% of the value of the products to be supplied by the nonmanufacturer must be the products of one or more domestic small business manufacturers or processors.\n\n(B) For a multiple item procurement where a waiver as described in § 121.406(b)(5) of this chapter is granted for one or more items, compliance with the limitation on subcontracting requirement will be determined by combining the value of the items supplied by domestic small business manufacturers or processors with the value of the items subject to a waiver. As such, as long as the value of the items to be supplied by domestic small business manufacturers or processors plus the value of the items to be supplied that are subject to a waiver account for at least 50% of the value of the contract, the limitations on subcontracting requirement is met.\n\n(C) For a multiple item procurement, the same small business concern may act as both a manufacturer and a nonmanufacturer.\n\n(3) In the case of a contract for general construction, it will not pay more than 85% of the amount paid by the government to it to firms that are not similarly situated. Any work that a similarly situated subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the 85% subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. Cost of materials are excluded and not considered to be subcontracted.\n\n(4) In the case of a contract for special trade contractors, no more than 75% of the amount paid by the government to the prime may be paid to firms that are not similarly situated. Any work that a similarly situated subcontractor further subcontracts will count towards the 75% subcontract amount that cannot be exceeded. Cost of materials are excluded and not considered to be subcontracted.\n\n(b) Mixed contracts. Where a contract integrates any combination of services, supplies, or construction, the contracting officer shall select the appropriate NAICS code as prescribed in § 121.402(b) of this chapter. The contracting officer's selection of the applicable NAICS code is determinative as to which limitation on subcontracting and performance requirement applies. Based on the NAICS code selected, the relevant limitation on subcontracting requirement identified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section will apply only to that portion of the contract award amount. In no case shall more than one limitation on subcontracting requirement apply to the same contract.\n\n(c) Subcontracts to similarly situated entities. A small business concern prime contractor that receives a contract listed in paragraph (a) of this section and spends contract amounts on a subcontractor that is a similarly situated entity shall not consider those subcontracted amounts as subcontracted for purposes of determining whether the small business concern prime contractor has violated paragraph (a) of this section, to the extent the subcontractor performs the work with its own employees. Any work that the similarly situated subcontractor does not perform with its own employees shall be considered subcontracted. SBA will also exclude a subcontract to a similarly situated entity from consideration under the ostensible subcontractor rule (§ 121.103(h)(3)). A prime contractor may no longer count a similarly situated entity towards compliance with the limitations on subcontracting where the subcontractor ceases to qualify as small or under the relevant socioeconomic status.\n\n(d) Determining compliance with applicable limitation on subcontracting. The period of time used to determine compliance for a total or partial set-aside contract will generally be the base term and then each subsequent option period. However, for a multi-agency set aside contract where more than one agency can issue orders under the contract, the ordering agency must use the period of performance for each order to determine compliance and monitor compliance with the limitations on subcontracting for that specific order. At the end of performance of the order, the ordering contracting officer should then inform the contracting officer for the underlying multi-agency contract if the ordering contracting officer knows that the contractor has failed to meet the applicable limitations on subcontracting requirement. For an order set aside under a full and open contract or a full and open contract with reserve, the agency will use the period of performance for each order to determine compliance unless the order is competed among small and other-than-small businesses (in which case the subcontracting limitations will not apply).\n\n(1) The contracting officer, in his or her discretion, may require the concern to comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting and the nonmanufacturer rule for each order awarded under a total or partial set-aside contract.\n\n(2) Compliance will be considered an element of responsibility and not a component of size eligibility.\n\n(3) Work performed by an independent contractor shall be considered a subcontract, and may count toward meeting the applicable limitation on subcontracting where the independent contractor qualifies as a similarly situated entity. Except with respect to staffing contracts, work performed by an employee obtained from a temporary employee agency, professional employer organization, or leasing concern shall be treated as the recipient concern's self-performance. The work performed by employees leased to the small business prime contractor will therefore not count against the applicable limitation on subcontracting.\n\n(e) Past Performance Evaluation. Where an agency determines that a contractor has not met the applicable limitation on subcontracting requirement at the conclusion of contract performance, the agency must notify the business concern and give it the opportunity to explain any extenuating or mitigating circumstances that negatively impacted its ability to do so.\n\n(1) Where a small business does not provide any extenuating or mitigating circumstances or the agency determines that the concern's failure to meet the applicable limitation on subcontracting requirement was not beyond the concern's control, the agency may not give a satisfactory or higher past performance rating for the appropriate factor or subfactor in accordance with FAR 42.1503.\n\n(2) Where a contracting officer determines that extenuating circumstances warrant a satisfactory/positive past performance evaluation for the appropriate evaluation factor or subfactor and the individual at least one level above the contracting officer concurs with that determination, a satisfactory or higher past performance rating may be given.\n\n(i) Extenuating or mitigating circumstances that could lead to a satisfactory/positive rating include, but are not limited to, unforeseen labor shortages, modifications to the contract's scope of work which were requested or directed by the Government, emergency or rapid response requirements that demand immediate subcontracting actions by the prime small business concern, unexpected changes to a subcontractor's designation as a similarly situated entity (as defined in § 125.1), differing site or environmental conditions which arose during the course of performance, force majeure events, and the contractor's good faith reliance upon a similarly situated subcontractor's representation of size or relevant socioeconomic status.\n\n(ii) An agency cannot rely on any circumstances that were within the contractor's control, or those which could have been mitigated without imposing an undue cost or burden on the contractor.\n\n(f) Inapplicability of limitations on subcontracting. The limitations on subcontracting do not apply to:\n\n(1) Small business set-aside contracts with a value that is greater than the micro-purchase threshold but less than or equal to the simplified acquisition threshold (as both terms are defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101); or\n\n(2) Subcontracts (except where a prime is relying on a similarly situated entity to meet the applicable limitations on subcontracting).\n\n(3) For contracts where an independent contractor is not otherwise treated as an employee of the concern for which he/she is performing work for size purposes under § 121.106(a) of this chapter, work performed by the independent contractor shall be considered a subcontract. Such work will count toward meeting the applicable limitation on subcontracting where the independent contractor qualifies as a similarly situated entity.\n\n(4) Contracting officers may, at their discretion, require the contractor to demonstrate its compliance with the limitations on subcontracting at any time during performance and upon completion of a contract if the information regarding such compliance is not already available to the contracting officer. Evidence of compliance includes, but is not limited to, invoices, copies of subcontracts, or a list of the value of tasks performed.\n\n(g) Request to change applicable limitation on subcontracting. SBA may use different percentages if the Administrator determines that such action is necessary to reflect conventional industry practices among small business concerns that are below the numerical size standard for businesses in that industry group. Representatives of a national trade or industry group or any interested SBC may request a change in subcontracting percentage requirements for the categories defined by six digit industry codes in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) pursuant to the following procedures:\n\n(1) Format of request. Requests from representatives of a trade or industry group and interested SBCs should be in writing and sent or delivered to the Director, Office of Government Contracting, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 3rd Street SW., Washington, DC 20416. The requester must demonstrate to SBA that a change in percentage is necessary to reflect conventional industry practices among small business concerns that are below the numerical size standard for businesses in that industry category, and must support its request with information including, but not limited to:\n\n(i) Information relative to the economic conditions and structure of the entire national industry;\n\n(ii) Market data, technical changes in the industry and industry trends;\n\n(iii) Specific reasons and justifications for the change in the subcontracting percentage;\n\n(iv) The effect such a change would have on the Federal procurement process; and\n\n(v) Information demonstrating how the proposed change would promote the purposes of the small business, 8(a), SDVOSB, VOSB, HUBZone, WOSB, or EDWOSB programs.\n\n(2) Notice to public. Upon an adequate preliminary showing to SBA, SBA will publish in the Federal Register a notice of its receipt of a request that it considers a change in the subcontracting percentage requirements for a particular industry. The notice will identify the group making the request, and give the public an opportunity to submit information and arguments in both support and opposition.\n\n(3) Comments. SBA will provide a period of not less than 30 days for public comment in response to the Federal Register notice.\n\n(4) Decision. SBA will render its decision after the close of the comment period. If SBA decides against a change, SBA will publish notice of its decision in the Federal Register. Concurrent with the notice, SBA will advise the requester of its decision in writing. If SBA decides in favor of a change, SBA will propose an appropriate change to this part.\n\n(h) Penalties. Whoever violates the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section shall be subject to the penalties prescribed in 15 U.S.C. 645(d), except that the fine shall be treated as the greater of $500,000 or the dollar amount spent, in excess of permitted levels, by the entity on subcontractors. A party's failure to comply with the spirit and intent of a subcontract with a similarly situated entity may be considered a basis for debarment on the grounds, including but not limited to, that the parties have violated the terms of a Government contract or subcontract pursuant to FAR 9.406-2(b)(1)(i) (48 CFR 9.406-2(b)(1)(i)).\n\n[81 FR 34262, May 31, 2016, as amended at 81 FR 67093, Sept. 30, 2016; 83 FR 12852, Mar. 26, 2018; 84 FR 65239, Nov. 26, 2019; 84 FR 65664, Nov. 29, 2019; 85 FR 66192, Oct. 16, 2020; 87 FR 73412, Nov. 29, 2022; 88 FR 26210, Apr. 27, 2023; 89 FR 102491, Dec. 17, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. A joint venture of two or more business concerns may submit an offer as a small business for a Federal procurement, subcontract or sale so long as each concern is small under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract, or qualify as small under one of the exceptions to affiliation set forth in § 121.103(h)(4) of this chapter.\n\n(b) Contents of joint venture agreement. (1) A joint venture agreement between two or more entities that individually qualify as small need not be in any specific form or contain any specific conditions in order for the joint venture to qualify as a small business.\n\n(2) Every joint venture agreement to perform a contract set aside or reserved for small business between a protégé small business and its SBA-approved mentor authorized by § 125.9 must contain a provision:\n\n(i) Setting forth the purpose of the joint venture;\n\n(ii) Designating a small business as the managing venturer of the joint venture, and designating a named employee of the small business managing venturer as the manager with ultimate responsibility for performance of the contract (the “Responsible Manager”).\n\n(A) The managing venturer is responsible for controlling the day-to-day management and administration of the contractual performance of the joint venture, but other partners to the joint venture may participate in all corporate governance activities and decisions of the joint venture as is commercially customary. The joint venture agreement may not give to a non-managing venturer negative control over activities of the joint venture, unless those provisions would otherwise be commercially customary for a joint venture agreement for a government contract outside of SBA's programs. A non-managing venturer's approval may be required in, among other things, determining what contract opportunities the joint venture should seek and initiating litigation on behalf of the joint venture.\n\n(B) The individual identified as the Responsible Manager of the joint venture need not be an employee of the small business at the time the joint venture submits an offer, but, if he or she is not, there must be a signed letter of intent that the individual commits to be employed by the small business if the joint venture is the successful offeror. The individual identified as the Responsible Manager cannot be employed by the mentor and become an employee of the small business for purposes of performance under the joint venture.\n\n(C) Although the joint venture managers responsible for orders issued under an IDIQ contract need not be employees of the protégé, those managers must report to and be supervised by the joint venture's Responsible Manager;\n\n(iii) Stating that with respect to a separate legal entity joint venture, the small business must own at least 51% of the joint venture entity;\n\n(iv) Stating that the small business participant(s) must receive profits from the joint venture commensurate with the work performed by them, or a percentage agreed to by the parties to the joint venture whereby the small business participant(s) receive profits from the joint venture that exceed the percentage commensurate with the work performed by them, and that at the termination of a joint venture, any funds remaining in the joint venture bank account shall be distributed according to the percentage of ownership;\n\n(v) Providing for the establishment and administration of a special bank account in the name of the joint venture. This account must require the signature or consent of all parties to the joint venture for any payments made by the joint venture to its members for services performed. All payments due the joint venture for performance on a contract set aside or reserved for small business will be deposited in the special account; all expenses incurred under the contract will be paid from the account as well;\n\n(vi) Itemizing all major equipment, facilities, and other resources to be furnished by each party to the joint venture, with a detailed schedule of cost or value of each, where practical. If a contract is indefinite in nature, such as an indefinite quantity contract or a multiple award contract where the level of effort or scope of work is not known, the joint venture must provide a general description of the anticipated major equipment, facilities, and other resources to be furnished by each party to the joint venture, without a detailed schedule of cost or value of each, or in the alternative, specify how the parties to the joint venture will furnish such resources to the joint venture once a definite scope of work is made publicly available;\n\n(vii) Specifying the responsibilities of the parties with regard to negotiation of the contract, source of labor, and contract performance, including ways that the parties to the joint venture will ensure that the joint venture and the small business partner(s) to the joint venture will meet the performance of work requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, where practical. If a contract is indefinite in nature, such as an indefinite quantity contract or a multiple award contract where the level of effort or scope of work is not known, the joint venture must provide a general description of the anticipated responsibilities of the parties with regard to negotiation of the contract, source of labor, and contract performance, not including the ways that the parties to the joint venture will ensure that the joint venture and the small business partner(s) to the joint venture will meet the performance of work requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, or in the alternative, specify how the parties to the joint venture will define such responsibilities once a definite scope of work is made publicly available;\n\n(viii) Obligating all parties to the joint venture to ensure performance of a contract set aside or reserved for small business and to complete performance despite the withdrawal of any member;\n\n(ix) Designating that accounting and other administrative records relating to the joint venture be kept in the office of the small business managing venturer, unless approval to keep them elsewhere is granted by the District Director or his/her designee upon written request;\n\n(x) Requiring that the final original records be retained by the small business managing venturer upon completion of any contract set aside or reserved for small business that was performed by the joint venture;\n\n(xi) Stating that annual performance-of-work statements required by paragraph (h)(1) must be submitted to SBA and the relevant contracting officer not later than 45 days after each operating year of the joint venture; and\n\n(xii) Stating that the project-end performance-of-work required by paragraph (h)(2) must be submitted to SBA and the relevant contracting officer no later than 90 days after completion of the contract.\n\n(c) Performance of work. (1) For any contract set aside or reserved for small business that is to be performed by a joint venture between a small business protégé and its SBA-approved mentor authorized by § 125.9, the joint venture must perform the applicable percentage of work required by § 125.6, and the small business partner to the joint venture must perform at least 40% of the work performed by the joint venture. Except as set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the 40% calculation for protégé workshare follows the same rules as those set forth in § 125.6 concerning supplies, construction, and mixed contracts, including the exclusion of the same costs from the limitation on subcontracting calculation (e.g., cost of materials excluded from the calculation in construction contracts).\n\n(2) The work performed by the small business partner to a joint venture must be more than administrative or ministerial functions so that it gains substantive experience.\n\n(3) The amount of work done by the partners will be aggregated and the work done by the small business protégé partner must be at least 40% of the total done by the partners. In determining the amount of work done by a mentor participating in a joint venture with a small business protégé, all work done by the mentor and any of its affiliates at any subcontracting tier will be counted.\n\n(4) Work performed by a similarly situated entity will not count toward the requirement that a protégé must perform at least 40% of the work performed by a joint venture.\n\n(d) Certification of compliance. Prior to the performance of any contract set aside or reserved for small business by a joint venture between a protégé small business and a mentor authorized by § 125.9, the small business partner to the joint venture must submit a written certification to the contracting officer and SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, stating as follows:\n\n(1) The parties have entered into a joint venture agreement that fully complies with paragraph (b) of this section;\n\n(2) The parties will perform the contract in compliance with the joint venture agreement and with the performance of work requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(e) Capabilities, past performance and experience. When evaluating the capabilities, past performance, experience, business systems and certifications of an entity submitting an offer for a contract set aside or reserved for small business as a joint venture established pursuant to this section, a procuring activity must consider work done and qualifications held individually by each partner to the joint venture as well as any work done by the joint venture itself previously.\n\n(1) A procuring activity has discretion whether to require a protégé or lead small business member of a joint venture to demonstrate some level of past performance and/or experience. It may rely solely on the past performance and experience of the mentor or non-similarly situated joint venture partner, or it may require some level of past performance and/or experience of the protégé or lead small business member. Where it requires some level of past performance and/or experience of the protégé or lead small business firm, the procuring activity shall not require that firm to individually meet all the same evaluation or responsibility criteria as that required of other offerors generally.\n\n(2) If a procuring activity requires a protégé or lead small business joint venture partner to demonstrate some successful performance and/or experience on fewer previous contracts of lower values than that required of other offerors generally, successful performance by the protégé or lead small business firm on the contracts it identifies shall be rated equivalently to successful performance by the mentor or non-similarly situated partner to the joint venture or any other individual offeror on the higher valued contracts they identify.\n\n(3) The partners to the joint venture in the aggregate must demonstrate the past performance, experience, business systems and certifications necessary to perform the contract.\n\n(f) Contract execution. The procuring activity will execute a contract set aside or reserved for small business in the name of the joint venture entity when there is a separate legal entity joint venture or the name of a small business partner to the joint venture when there is an informal joint venture, but in either case will identify the award as one to a small business joint venture or a small business mentor-protégé joint venture, as appropriate.\n\n(g) Inspection of records. The joint venture partners must allow SBA's authorized representatives, including representatives authorized by the SBA Inspector General, during normal business hours, access to its files to inspect and copy all records and documents relating to the joint venture.\n\n(h) Performance of work reports. In connection with any contract set aside or reserved for small business that is awarded to a joint venture between a protégé small business and a mentor authorized by § 125.9, the small business partner must describe how it is meeting or has met the applicable performance of work requirements for each contract set aside or reserved for small business that it performs as a joint venture.\n\n(1) The small business partner to the joint venture must annually submit a report to the relevant contracting officer and to the SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, explaining how the performance of work requirements are being met for each contract set aside or reserved for small business that is performed during the year.\n\n(2) At the completion of every contract set aside or reserved for small business that is awarded to a joint venture between a protégé small business and a mentor authorized by § 125.9, and upon request by SBA or the relevant contracting officer prior to contract completion, the small business partner to the joint venture must submit a report to the relevant contracting officer and to SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, explaining how and certifying that the performance of work requirements were met for the contract, and further certifying that the contract was performed in accordance with the provisions of the joint venture agreement that are required under paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(i) Basis for suspension or debarment. For any joint venture between a protégé small business and a mentor authorized by § 125.9, the Government may consider the following as a ground for suspension or debarment as a willful violation of a regulatory provision or requirement applicable to a public agreement or transaction:\n\n(1) Failure to enter a joint venture agreement that complies with paragraph (b) of this section;\n\n(2) Failure to perform a contract in accordance with the joint venture agreement or performance of work requirements in paragraph (c) of this section; or\n\n(3) Failure to submit the certification required by paragraph (d) of this section or comply with paragraph (g) of this section.\n\n(j) Compliance with performance of work requirements. Any person with information concerning a joint venture's compliance with the performance of work requirements may report that information to SBA and/or the SBA Office of Inspector General.\n\n[81 FR 48585, July 25, 2016, as amended at 81 FR 94941, Dec. 27, 2016; 85 FR 66193, Oct. 16, 2020; 88 FR 26211, Apr. 27, 2023; 88 FR 70343, Oct. 11, 2023; 89 FR 102491, Dec. 17, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. The small business mentor-protégé program is designed to enhance the capabilities of protégé firms by requiring approved mentors to provide business development assistance to protégé firms and to improve the protégé firms' ability to successfully compete for federal contracts. This assistance may include technical and/or management assistance; financial assistance in the form of equity investments and/or loans; subcontracts (either from the mentor to the protégé or from the protégé to the mentor); trade education; and/or assistance in performing prime contracts with the Government through joint venture arrangements. Mentors are encouraged to provide assistance relating to the performance of contracts set aside or reserved for small business so that protégé firms may more fully develop their capabilities.\n\n(b) Mentors. Any for-profit business concern that demonstrates a commitment and the ability to assist small business concerns may act as a mentor and receive benefits as set forth in this section. This includes other than small businesses.\n\n(1) In order to qualify as a mentor, a concern must demonstrate that it:\n\n(i) Is capable of carrying out its responsibilities to assist the protégé firm under the proposed mentor-protégé agreement;\n\n(ii) Does not appear on the Federal list of debarred or suspended contractors; and\n\n(iii) Can impart value to a protégé firm due to lessons learned and practical experience gained or through its knowledge of general business operations and government contracting.\n\n(2) (i) SBA will decline an application if SBA determines that the mentor does not possess good character or a favorable financial position, employs or otherwise controls the managers or key employees of the protégé, or is otherwise affiliated with the protégé.\n\n(ii) SBA may terminate the mentor-protégé agreement if:\n\n(A) SBA determines that the mentor does not possess good character or a favorable financial position;\n\n(B) SBA determines that the mentor was affiliated with the protégé at the time of application or becomes affiliated with the protégé for reasons other than the mentor-protégé agreement or assistance provided under the agreement; or\n\n(C) Key managers or personnel become employees of both the mentor and protégé firms at the same time.\n\n(3) In order for SBA to agree to allow a mentor to have more than one protégé at a time, the mentor and proposed additional protégé must demonstrate that the added mentor-protégé relationship will not adversely affect the development of either protégé firm (e.g., the second firm may not be a competitor of the first firm).\n\n(i) A mentor that has more than one protégé cannot submit competing offers in response to a solicitation for a specific procurement through separate joint ventures with different protégés.\n\n(ii) A mentor (including in the aggregate a parent company and all of its subsidiaries) generally cannot have more than three protégés at one time.\n\n(A) The first two mentor-protégé relationships approved by SBA between a specific mentor and a small business that has its principal office located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico do not count against the limit of three proteges that a mentor can have at one time.\n\n(B) Where a mentor purchases another business entity that is also an SBA-approved mentor of one or more protégé small business concerns and the purchasing mentor commits to honoring the obligations under the seller's mentor-protégé agreement(s), that entity may have more than three protégés (i.e., those of the purchased concern in addition to those of its own). In such a case, the entity could not add another protégé until it fell below three in total.\n\n(4) A mentor cannot be a contract holder through joint ventures with two protégé small business concerns on the same small business multiple award contract or small business reserve on a multiple award contract at the same time.\n\n(i) Where a mentor purchases another business entity that is also an SBA-approved mentor that is a contract holder as a joint venture with a protégé small business and the mentor is also a contract holder with a protégé small business on that same multiple award contract, the mentor must exit one of those joint venture relationships.\n\n(ii) The protégé firm connected to the joint venture from which the mentor exits may seek to:\n\n(A) Acquire the new mentor's interest in the small business multiple award contract or reserve and, where necessary and appropriate, novate such contract or reserve to itself only pursuant to FAR 42.1204; or\n\n(B) Replace the new mentor with another business in the joint venture such that the revised joint venture will continue to qualify as small and be eligible for orders issued under the multiple award contract.\n\n(C) SBA will not find affiliation where a protégé obtains financing under normal commercial terms in order to purchase the mentor's interest in a multiple award contract.\n\n(c) Protégés. (1) In order to initially qualify as a protégé firm, a concern must qualify as small for the size standard corresponding to its primary NAICS code or identify that it is seeking business development assistance with respect to a secondary NAICS code and qualify as small for the size standard corresponding to that NAICS code.\n\n(i) A firm may self-certify that it qualifies as small for its primary or identified secondary NAICS code.\n\n(ii) Where a small business concern seeks to qualify as a protégé in a secondary NAICS code, the concern must demonstrate how the mentor-protégé relationship will help it further develop or expand its current capabilities in that secondary NAICS code. SBA will not approve a mentor-protégé relationship in a secondary NAICS code in which the small business concern has no prior experience. SBA may approve a mentor-protégé relationship where the small business concern can demonstrate that it has performed work in one or more similar NAICS codes or where the NAICS code in which the small business concern seeks a mentor-protégé relationship is a logical business progression to work previously performed by the concern.\n\n(2) A protégé firm may generally have only one mentor at a time.\n\n(i) SBA may approve a second mentor for a particular protégé firm where the second relationship will not compete or otherwise conflict with the first mentor-protégé relationship, and:\n\n(A) The second relationship pertains to an unrelated NAICS code; or\n\n(B) The protégé firm is seeking to acquire a specific expertise that the first mentor does not possess.\n\n(ii) Where SBA has approved two mentor-protégé relationships for the same protégé small business, the protégé may enter joint venture relationships with each of its two mentors. However, those joint ventures cannot compete against each other and cannot be contract holders on the same multiple award contract.\n\n(3) SBA may authorize a small business to be both a protégé and a mentor at the same time where the small business can demonstrate that the second relationship will not compete or otherwise conflict with the first mentor-protégé relationship.\n\n(4) A protégé may generally have a total of two mentor-protégé agreements with different mentors.\n\n(i) Each mentor-protégé agreement may last for no more than six years, as set forth in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.\n\n(ii) If a mentor-protégé agreement is terminated within 18 months from the date SBA approved the agreement, that mentor-protégé relationship will generally not count as one of the two mentor-protégé relationships that a small business may enter as a protégé. However, where a specific small business protégé appears to enter into many short-term mentor-protégé relationships as a means of extending its program eligibility as a protégé, SBA may determine that the business concern has exhausted its participation in the mentor-protégé program and not approve an additional mentor-protégé relationship.\n\n(iii) If during the evaluation of the mentor-protégé relationship pursuant to paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section SBA determines that a mentor has not provided the business development assistance set forth in its mentor-protégé agreement or that the quality of the assistance provided was not satisfactory, SBA may terminate the mentor-protégé relationship. Where SBA or the parties themselves terminate a mentor-protégé relationship, SBA may allow the protégé to substitute another mentor for the time remaining in the mentor-protégé agreement without counting against the two-mentor limit.\n\n(iv) Instead of having a six-year mentor-protégé relationship with two separate mentors, a protégé may seek to extend or renew a mentor-protégé relationship with the same mentor for a second six-year term. In order for SBA to approve an extension or renewal of a mentor-protégé relationship with the same mentor, the mentor must commit to providing additional business development assistance to the protégé. Whether a protégé has a mentor-protégé relationship with two different mentors or the same mentor for a second six-year period, a concern cannot be a protégé for a total of more than 12 years.\n\n(5) Where a business concern purchases another business concern that is currently the mentor of a protégé firm, that business concern shall become the new mentor of the protégé if it commits to honoring the obligations under the seller's mentor-protégé agreement or the purchasing business concern and the protégé negotiate a new mentor-protégé agreement that SBA approves. Where that occurs, that new mentor-protégé relationship will be effective for no longer than six years minus the length of the mentor-protégé relationship with the seller mentor.\n\n(i) The protégé firm can terminate its mentor-protégé relationship only if the purchasing business concern and the protégé firm cannot agree on either continuing with the previous mentor-protégé agreement or negotiating a new mentor-protégé agreement that is acceptable to SBA.\n\n(ii) Where a mentor-protégé relationship is terminated, the protégé firm may seek another business concern to enter a mentor-protégé relationship for a duration not to exceed six years minus the length of the mentor-protégé relationship with the former mentor.\n\n(d) Benefits. (1) A protégé and mentor may joint venture as a small business for any government prime contract, subcontract or sale, provided the protégé qualifies as small for the procurement or sale. Such a joint venture may seek any type of small business contract (i.e., small business set-aside, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVO, or WOSB) for which the protégé firm qualifies (e.g., a protégé firm that qualifies as a WOSB could seek a WOSB set-aside as a joint venture with its SBA-approved mentor). Similarly, a joint venture between a protégé and mentor may seek a subcontract as a HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, SDVO small business, or WOSB provided the protégé individually qualifies as such.\n\n(i) SBA must approve the mentor-protégé agreement before the two firms may submit an offer as a joint venture on a particular government prime contract or subcontract in order for the joint venture to receive the exclusion from affiliation.\n\n(ii) In order to receive the exclusion from affiliation, the joint venture must meet the requirements set forth in § 125.8(b)(2), (c), and (d).\n\n(iii) A joint venture between a protégé and its mentor will qualify as a small business for any procurement for which the protégé individually qualifies as small. Once a protégé firm no longer qualifies as a small business for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code under which SBA approved its mentor-protégé relationship, any joint venture between the protégé and its mentor will no longer be able to seek additional contracts or subcontracts as a small business for any NAICS code having the same or lower size standard. A joint venture between a protégé and its mentor could seek additional contract opportunities in NAICS codes having a size standard for which the protégé continues to qualify as small. A change in the protégé's size status does not generally affect contracts previously awarded to a joint venture between the protégé and its mentor.\n\n(A) Except for contracts with durations of more than five years (including options), a contract awarded to a joint venture between a protégé and a mentor as a small business continues to qualify as an award to small business for the life of that contract and the joint venture remains obligated to continue performance on that contract.\n\n(B) For contracts with durations of more than five years (including options), where size re-certification is required under § 121.404(g)(3) of this chapter no more than 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract and no more than 120 days prior to exercising any option thereafter, once the protégé no longer qualifies as small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract, the joint venture will not be able re-certify itself to be a small business for that contract. The rules set forth in § 121.404(g)(3) of this chapter apply in such circumstances.\n\n(iv) Where a mentor seeks to sell its interest in a mentor-protégé joint venture, the protégé firm shall have a right of first refusal to purchase that interest. SBA will not find affiliation where a protégé obtains financing under normal commercial terms in order to purchase the mentor's interest in a mentor-protégé joint venture.\n\n(2) In order to raise capital, the protégé firm may agree to sell or otherwise convey to the mentor an equity interest of up to 40% in the protégé firm.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding the mentor-protégé relationship, a protégé firm may qualify for other assistance as a small business, including SBA financial assistance.\n\n(4) No determination of affiliation or control may be found between a protégé firm and its mentor based solely on the mentor-protégé agreement or any assistance provided pursuant to the agreement. However, affiliation may be found for other reasons set forth in § 121.103 of this chapter.\n\n(5) Where appropriate, procuring activities may provide incentives in the contract evaluation process to a firm that will provide significant subcontracting work to its SBA-approved protégé firm.\n\n(6) A mentor that provides a subcontract to its protégé that is a covered territory business, or that has its principal office located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, may:\n\n(i) receive positive consideration for the mentor's past performance evaluation, and (ii) apply costs incurred for providing training to such protege toward the subcontracting goals contained in the subcontracting plan of the mentor.\n\n(ii) [Reserved]\n\n(e) Written agreement. (1) The mentor and protégé firms must enter a written agreement setting forth an assessment of the protégé's needs and providing a detailed description and timeline for the delivery of the assistance the mentor commits to provide to address those needs (e.g., management and or technical assistance; loans and/or equity investments; bonding; use of equipment; export assistance; assistance as a subcontractor under prime contracts being performed by the protégé; cooperation on joint venture projects; or subcontracts under prime contracts being performed by the mentor). The mentor-protégé agreement must:\n\n(i) Specifically identify the business development assistance to be provided and address how the assistance will help the protégé enhance its growth and/or foster or acquire needed capabilities;\n\n(ii) Identify the specific entity or entities that will provide assistance to or participate in joint ventures with the protégé where the mentor is a parent or subsidiary concern;\n\n(iii) Establish a single point of contact in the mentor concern who is responsible for managing and implementing the mentor-protégé agreement; and\n\n(iv) Provide that the mentor will provide such assistance to the protégé firm for at least one year.\n\n(2) A firm seeking SBA's approval to be a protégé must identify any other mentor-protégé relationship it has through another federal agency or SBA and provide a copy of each such mentor-protégé agreement to SBA.\n\n(i) The small business mentor-protégé agreement must identify how the assistance to be provided by the proposed mentor is different from assistance provided to the protégé through another mentor-protégé relationship, either with the same or a different mentor.\n\n(ii) A firm seeking SBA's approval to be a protégé may terminate a mentor-protégé relationship it has through another agency and use any not yet provided assistance identified in the other mentor-protégé agreement as part of the assistance that will be provided through the small business mentor-protégé relationship. Any assistance that has already been provided through another mentor-protégé relationship cannot be identified as assistance that will be provided through the small business mentor-protégé relationship.\n\n(3) The written agreement must be approved by the Associate Administrator for Business Development (AA/BD) or his/her designee. The agreement will not be approved if SBA determines that the assistance to be provided is not sufficient to promote any real developmental gains to the protégé, or if SBA determines that the agreement is merely a vehicle to enable the mentor to receive small business contracts.\n\n(4) The agreement must provide that either the protégé or the mentor may terminate the agreement with 30 days advance notice to the other party to the mentor-protégé relationship and to SBA.\n\n(5) The term of a mentor-protégé agreement may not exceed six years. If an initial mentor-protégé agreement is for less than six years, it may be extended by mutual agreement prior to the expiration date for an additional amount of time that would total no more than six years from its inception (e.g., if the initial mentor-protégé agreement was for two years, it could be extended for an additional four years by consent of the two parties; if the initial mentor-protégé agreement was for three years, it could be extended for an additional three years by consent of the two parties). Unless rescinded in writing as a result of an SBA review, the mentor-protégé relationship will automatically renew without additional written notice of continuation or extension to the protégé firm.\n\n(6) SBA must approve all changes to a mentor-protégé agreement in advance, and any changes made to the agreement must be provided in writing. If the parties to the mentor-protégé relationship change the mentor-protégé agreement without prior approval by SBA, SBA shall terminate the mentor-protégé relationship and may also propose suspension or debarment of one or both of the firms pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section where appropriate.\n\n(7) If control of the mentor changes (through a stock sale or otherwise), the previously approved mentor-protégé relationship may continue provided that, after the change in control, the mentor expresses in writing to SBA that it acknowledges the mentor-protégéagreement and certifies that it will continue to abide by its terms.\n\n(8) SBA may terminate the mentor-protégé agreement at any time if it determines that the protégé is not benefiting from the relationship or that the parties are not complying with any term or condition of the mentor protégé agreement. In the event SBA terminates the relationship, the mentor-protégé joint venture is obligated to complete any previously awarded contracts unless the procuring agency issues a stop work order.\n\n(f) Decision to decline mentor-protégé relationship. Where SBA declines to approve a specific mentor-protégé agreement, SBA will issue a written decision setting forth its reason(s) for the decline. The small business concern seeking to be a protégé cannot attempt to enter into another mentor-protégé relationship with the same mentor for a period of 60 calendar days from the date of the final decision. The small business concern may, however, submit another proposed mentor-protégé agreement with a different proposed mentor at any time after the SBA's final decline decision.\n\n(g) Evaluating the mentor-protégé relationship. SBA will review the mentor-protégé relationship annually. SBA will ask the protégé for its assessment of how the mentor-protégé relationship is working, whether or not the protégé received the agreed upon business development assistance, and whether the protégé would recommend the mentor to be a mentor for another small business in the future. At any point in the mentor-protégé relationship where a protégé believes that a mentor has not provided the business development assistance set forth in its mentor-protégé agreement or that the quality of the assistance provided did not meet its expectations, the protégé can ask SBA to intervene on its behalf with the mentor.\n\n(1) Within 30 days of the anniversary of SBA's approval of the mentor-protégé agreement, the protégé must report to SBA for the preceding year:\n\n(i) All technical and/or management assistance provided by the mentor to the protégé;\n\n(ii) All loans to and/or equity investments made by the mentor in the protégé;\n\n(iii) All subcontracts awarded to the protégé by the mentor and all subcontracts awarded to the mentor by the protégé, and the value of each subcontract;\n\n(iv) All federal contracts awarded to the mentor-protégé relationship as a joint venture (designating each as a small business set-aside, small business reserve, or unrestricted procurement), the value of each contract, and the percentage of the contract performed and the percentage of revenue accruing to each party to the joint venture; and\n\n(v) A narrative describing the success such assistance has had in addressing the developmental needs of the protégé and addressing any problems encountered.\n\n(2) The protégé must report the mentoring services it receives by category and hours.\n\n(3) The protégé must annually certify to SBA whether there has been any change in the terms of the agreement.\n\n(4) At any point in the mentor-protégé relationship where a protégé believes that a mentor has not provided the business development assistance set forth in its mentor-protégé agreement or that the quality of the assistance provided did not meet its expectations, the protégé can ask SBA to intervene on its behalf with the mentor.\n\n(5) SBA may decide not to approve continuation of a mentor-protégé agreement where:\n\n(i) SBA finds that the mentor has not provided the assistance set forth in the mentor-protégé agreement;\n\n(ii) SBA finds that the assistance provided by the mentor has not resulted in any material benefits or developmental gains to the protégé; or\n\n(iii) A protégé does not provide information relating to the mentor-protégé relationship, as set forth in paragraph (g).\n\n(h) Consequences of not providing assistance set forth in the mentor-protégé agreement. (1) Where SBA determines that a mentor may not have provided to the protégé firm the business development assistance set forth in its mentor-protégé agreement or that the quality of the assistance provided may not have been satisfactory, SBA will notify the mentor of such determination and afford the mentor an opportunity to respond. The mentor must respond within 30 days of the notification, presenting information demonstrating that it did satisfactorily provide the assistance set forth in the mentor-protégé agreement or explaining why it has not provided the agreed upon assistance and setting forth a definitive plan as to when it will provide such assistance. If the mentor fails to respond, does not adequately provide information demonstrating that it did satisfactorily provide the assistance set forth in the mentor-protégé agreement, does not supply adequate reasons for its failure to provide the agreed upon assistance, or does not set forth a definite plan to provide the assistance:\n\n(i) SBA will terminate the mentor-protégé agreement;\n\n(ii) The firm will be ineligible to again act as a mentor for a period of two years from the date SBA terminates the mentor-protégé agreement; and\n\n(iii) SBA may recommend to the relevant procuring agency to issue a stop work order for each federal contract for which the mentor and protégé are performing as a small business joint venture in order to encourage the mentor to comply with its mentor-protégé agreement. Where a protégé firm is able to independently complete performance of any such contract, SBA may recommend to the procuring agency to authorize a substitution of the protégé firm for the joint venture.\n\n(2) SBA may consider a mentor's failure to comply with the terms and conditions of an SBA-approved mentor-protégé agreement as a basis for debarment on the grounds, including but not limited to, that the mentor has not complied with the terms of a public agreement under 2 CFR 180.800(b).\n\n(i) Results of mentor-protégé relationship. (1) In order to assess the results of a mentor-protégé relationship upon its completion, the protégé must report to SBA whether it believed the mentor-protégé relationship was beneficial and describe any lasting benefits to the protégé.\n\n(2) Where a protégé does not report the results of a mentor-protégé relationship upon its completion, SBA will not approve a second mentor-protégé relationship either under this section or under § 124.520 of this chapter.\n\n[81 FR 48585, July 25, 2016, as amended at 85 FR 66194, Oct. 16, 2020; 87 FR 50927, Aug. 19, 2022; 88 FR 26211, Apr. 27, 2023; 89 FR 102492, Dec. 17, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. In accordance with sections 15(e)(5) and 8(d)(17) of the Small Business Act, agencies are required to consider the past performance of certain small business offerors that have been members of joint ventures or have been first-tier subcontractors. The agencies shall consider the small business' past performance for the evaluated contract or order similarly to a prime-contract past performance.\n\n(b) Small business concerns that have been members of joint ventures—(1) Joint venture past performance. (i) When submitting an offer for a prime contract, a small business concern that has been a member of a joint venture may elect to use the experience and past performance of the joint venture (whether or not the other joint venture partners were small business concerns) where the small business does not independently demonstrate past performance necessary for award. The small business concern, when making such an election, shall:\n\n(A) Identify to the contracting officer the joint venture of which the small business concern is or was a member;\n\n(B) Identify the contract or contracts of the joint venture that the small business elects to use for its experience and past performance for the prime contract offer; and\n\n(C) Inform the contracting officer what duties and responsibilities the concern carried out or is carrying out as part of the joint venture.\n\n(ii) A small business cannot identify and use as its own experience and past performance work that was performed exclusively by other partners to the joint venture.\n\n(2) Evaluation. When evaluating the past performance of a small business concern that has submitted an offer on a prime contract, the contracting officer shall consider the joint venture past performance that the concern elected to use under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, giving due consideration to the information provided under paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section for the performance of the evaluated contract or order. This includes where the small business concern lacks a past performance rating as a prime contractor in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System, or successor system used by the Federal Government to monitor or rate contractor past performance.\n\n(c) Small business concerns that have performed as first-tier subcontractors—(1) Responsibility of prime contractors. A small business concern may request a rating of its subcontractor past performance from the prime contractor for a contract on which the concern was a first-tier subcontractor and which included a subcontracting plan. The prime contractor shall provide the rating to the small business concern within 15 calendar days of the request. The rating provided by the prime contractor to the first-tier small business subcontractor shall utilize the five-scale ratings system found in FAR 42.1503 (48 CFR 42.1503): Exceptional, Very Good, Satisfactory, Marginal, and Unsatisfactory. The prime contractor must include, at a minimum, the following evaluation factors in the requested rating:\n\n(i) Technical (quality of product or service);\n\n(ii) Cost control (not applicable for firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment arrangements);\n\n(iii) Schedule/timeliness;\n\n(iv) Management or business relations; and\n\n(v) Other (as applicable).\n\n(2) Responsibility of first-tier small business subcontractors. A first-tier small business subcontractor must make the request for a performance rating from the prime contractor within 30 days after the completion of the period of performance for the prime contractor's contract with the Government. However, the prime contractor and the first-tier small business subcontractor may negotiate a later deadline for the request for a performance rating, but in no case can the prime contractor impose a deadline earlier than 30 days after the completion of the period of performance for the prime contractor's contract with the Government. The subcontractor may notify the contracting officer in the event that the prime contractor does not comply with its responsibility to submit a timely rating.\n\n(3) Joint ventures that performed as first-tier subcontractors. A small business member of a joint venture may request a past performance rating under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, where a joint venture performed as a first-tier subcontractor. The joint venture member may then submit the subcontractor past performance rating to a procuring agency in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(4) Evaluation. When evaluating the past performance of a small business concern that elected to use a rating for its offer on a prime contract, a contracting officer shall consider the concern's experience and rating of past performance as a first-tier subcontractor. This includes where the small business concern lacks a past performance rating as a prime contractor in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), or successor system used by the Federal Government to monitor or rate contractor past performance.\n\n[87 FR 43739, July 22, 2022]",

    "content": "(a) General. Recertification of size and small business program status (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB/EDWOSB, or SDVOSB) is required within 30 calendar days of a merger, acquisition, or sale of or by a concern or an affiliate of the concern, which results in a change in controlling interest.\n\n(1) A concern and the acquiring concern must recertify if each has received an award as a small business or small business program participant.\n\n(2) In the context of a joint venture, recertification is required from any partner to the joint venture that has merged or is party to the sale or acquisition.\n\n(3) Recertification does not change the terms and conditions of the award. The limitations on subcontracting, non-manufacturer and subcontracting plan requirements in effect at the time of award remain in effect throughout the life of the award regardless of whether a recertification is qualifying or disqualifying. However, a contracting officer may require a subcontracting plan if a prime contractor's size status changes from small to other than small as a result of a size recertification.\n\n(4) A size re-certification shall relate to the size standard in effect at the time of re-certification that corresponds to the NAICS code that was initially assigned to the award.\n\n(b) Long term contracts. For contracts (including multiple award contracts) and orders with durations of more than five years (including options), a concern must recertify its size and status no more than 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the award, and no more than 120 days prior to exercising any option thereafter. A contracting officer may also request size and/or status recertification, as he or she deems appropriate, prior to the 120-day point in the fifth year of a long-term contract or order. The agency and the contractor must immediately revise all applicable Federal contract databases to reflect the new size status.\n\n(c) Request by contracting officer. Recertification of size and small business program status is required where the contracting officer explicitly requires concerns to recertify their size or status in response to a solicitation for a set aside or reserved order or agreement.\n\n(d) Change in structure of entity-owned concern. Size or status recertification is not required when the ownership of a concern that is at least 51% owned by an Indian Tribe, Alaska Native Corporation, or Community Development Corporation changes to or from a wholly-owned business concern of the same entity, as long as the ultimate owner remains that entity.\n\n(e) Effect of Recertification—(1) Qualifying Recertification. A concern that has a qualifying recertification is generally considered to be a small business or small business program participant for up to five years from the date of the recertification and remains eligible for set-aside or reserved awards unless there is a subsequent disqualifying recertification.\n\n(2) Disqualifying Recertification—(i) Pending Set Aside or Reserved Award. If events triggering a disqualifying recertification under paragraph (a) of this section occur within 180 days after the date of an offer but prior to award, the concern is ineligible to receive the pending small business set aside or reserved award. The concern must notify the contracting officer of the change in its size or status. If events triggering a disqualifying recertification under paragraph (a) of this section occur more than 180 days after the date of an offer but prior to award, the concern is eligible to receive a pending single award or reserve and the award will count as an award to a small business or small business program participant for goaling purposes for up to five years from the date of the award unless there is a disqualifying recertification. However, where the underlying award is a multiple award small business set aside or reserve the concern is ineligible for the pending award because the concern would not be eligible for orders set aside for small business or set aside for a specific type of small business. See paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.\n\n(ii) Future Set Aside or Reserved Award—(A) Request for recertification on a specific order or agreement under an underlying multiple award contract that is set aside or reserved for small business. If a concern has a disqualifying size or status recertification in response to a contracting officer request for recertification on a specific order or agreement under an underlying multiple award contract that is set aside or reserved for small business (i.e., small business set-aside or reserve, 8(a) small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or women-owned/economically disadvantaged women-owned small business), the concern is ineligible for the specific order or agreement but remains eligible for other set aside or reserved awards and unrestricted awards.\n\n(1) Where an initially-small contract holder has naturally grown to be other than small and could not recertify as small for a specific order or agreement for which a contracting officer requested recertification, it may continue to qualify as small for other orders or agreements where a contracting officer does not request recertification.\n\n(2) Where an initially-eligible 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB or SDVOSB contract holder on an 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB or SDVOSB set-aside or reserve cannot recertify its status for a specific order or agreement for which a contracting officer requested recertification, it may continue to qualify as eligible for other competitively awarded orders or agreements where a contracting officer does not request recertification.\n\n(B) Other Events Triggering Recertification. (1) If a concern has a disqualifying recertification in response to a recertification requirement on a long-term multiple award contract or a recertification requirement following a merger, acquisition, or sale involving a business entity that does not itself qualify as small under the NAICS code assigned to the multiple award contract, the concern is ineligible to submit an offer for a set aside or reserved award after the triggering event occurs. The concern remains eligible for unrestricted awards under a multiple award contract and orders issued under a single award small business contract. In either case, a procuring agency cannot count the order as an award to small business or to the specific type of small business (i.e., 8(a), WOSB, SDVOSB, or HUBZone).\n\n(2) If a concern has a disqualifying recertification in response to a requirement to recertify size and/or status following a merger, acquisition, or sale involving another small business concern, the concern remains eligible for set-aside or reserved orders issued under a multiple award contract, but a procuring agency cannot count the order as an award to small business or to the specific type of small business (i.e., 8(a), WOSB, SDVOSB, or HUBZone).\n\n(iii) Options. (A) For a single award small business set-aside or reserve award or any unrestricted award, a concern that submits a disqualifying recertification remains eligible to receive options. The procuring agency cannot count the option period as an award to a small business or small business program participant for goaling purposes. Such a concern may make a qualifying recertification for a subsequent option period if it meets the applicable size standard or becomes a certified small business program participant.\n\n(B) For a multiple award contract that is set-aside or reserved for small business, a concern that submits a disqualifying recertification in response to a recertification requirement on a long-term contract or a recertification requirement following a merger, acquisition, or sale involving a business entity that does not itself qualify as small under the NAICS code assigned to the multiple award contract is ineligible to receive options.\n\n(C) For a multiple award contract that is set-aside or reserved for small business, a concern that submits a disqualifying recertification in response to a requirement to recertify size and/or status following a merger, acquisition, or sale involving another small business concern, the concern remains eligible to receive options. The procuring agency cannot count the option period as an award to a small business or to the specific type of small business (i.e., 8(a), WOSB, SDVOSB, or HUBZone). Such a concern may make a qualifying recertification for a subsequent option period if it meets the applicable size standard or becomes a certified small business program participant.\n\n(f) Joint venture recertifications. Where a joint venture must recertify its small business size status under paragraph (a) of this section, the joint venture can recertify as small where all parties to the joint venture qualify as small at the time of recertification, or the protégé small business in a still active mentor-protégé joint venture qualifies as small at the time of recertification. A joint venture can recertify as small even though the date of recertification occurs more than two years after the joint venture received its first contract award (i.e., recertification is not considered a new contract award under § 121.103(h).\n\n(g) Delayed effective date. Notwithstanding paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)(B) and (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section:\n\n(i) A firm that has a disqualifying size or status recertification due to a merger, acquisition or sale that occurs prior to January 17, 2026 remains eligible for orders issued under an underlying small business multiple award contract. However, the agency cannot count any new or pending orders issued pursuant to the contract, from that point forward, towards its small business and socioeconomic goals. This includes set-asides, partial set-asides, and reserves for 8(a) BD Participants, certified HUBZone small business concerns, SDVO SBCs, and ED/WOSBs.\n\n(ii) A firm that has a disqualifying size or status recertification prior to the end of the fifth year of a long-term contract remains eligible for any options to be exercised prior to January 17, 2026. However, the agency cannot count those options towards its small business and socioeconomic goals.\n\n[89 FR 102493, Dec. 17, 2024]",

SBA does not consider holders of permanent visas and resident aliens to be citizens.\n\nCommunity Development Corporation or CDC means a nonprofit organization responsible to residents of the area it serves which has received financial assistance under 42 U.S.C. 9805, et seq. or has received a letter from the Department of Health and Human Services affirming that it has received assistance under a successor program to that authorized by 42 U.S.C. 9805.\n\nConcern means a firm which satisfies the requirements in §§ 121.105(a) and (b) of this title.\n\nContract opportunity means a situation in which a requirement for a procurement exists, none of the exclusions from § 126.605 applies, and any applicable conditions in § 126.607 are met.\n\nContracting Officer has the meaning given that term in 41 U.S.C. 2101(1), which defines a contracting officer as a person who, by appointment in accordance with applicable regulations, has the authority to enter into a Federal agency procurement contract on behalf of the Government and to make determinations and findings with respect to such a contract.\n\nCounty means the political subdivisions recognized as a county by a state or commonwealth or which is an equivalent political subdivision such as a parish, borough, independent city, or municipio, where such subdivisions are not subdivisions within counties.\n\nD/HUB means the Director of SBA's Office of HUBZone.\n\nDecertify means the process by which SBA removes a concern as a certified HUBZone small business concern from DSBS (or successor system) upon a finding that the firm does not meet the HUBZone eligibility requirements or after a firm voluntarily withdraws from the HUBZone program.\n\nDynamic Small Business Search (DSBS) means the database that government agencies use to find small business contractors for upcoming contracts. The information a business provides when registering in SAM, as defined in this section, is used to populate DSBS. For HUBZone Program purposes, a concern's DSBS profile will indicate whether it is a certified HUBZone small business concern, and if so, the date it was certified.\n\nEmployee means an individual employed on a full-time, part-time, or other basis, so long as that individual generally works a minimum of 10 hours per week during the four-week period immediately prior to the relevant date of review. SBA may permit an individual to count as an employee if that individual works less than 10 hours in any week during the four-week period immediately prior to the relevant date of review provided the individual works at least 40 hours during that four-week period and the concern demonstrates a legitimate business reason for that work schedule.\n\n(1) To determine the number of hours worked by each individual employed by the business concern, SBA will review a concern's payroll records for the most recently completed pay periods that account for the four-week period immediately prior to the relevant date of review. To determine if an individual is an employee, SBA reviews the totality of circumstances, including criteria used by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for Federal income tax purposes and the factors set forth in SBA's Size Policy Statement No. 1 (51 FR 6099, February 20, 1986).\n\n(2) In general, the following are considered employees:\n\n(i) Individuals obtained from a temporary employee agency, from a concern primarily engaged in leasing employees, or through a union agreement, or co-employed pursuant to a Professional Employer Organization agreement;\n\n(ii) An individual who has an ownership interest in the concern and who works for the concern 80 hours or more during the four-week period immediately prior to the relevant date of review, whether or not the individual receives compensation;\n\n(iii) An owner who works less than 80 hours during the four-week period immediately prior to the relevant date of review, where another individual has not been hired to manage and direct the actions of the concern's employee(s);\n\n(iv) Reservists or National Guard members when called to active duty; and\n\n(v) Individuals who are on annual, sick, or maternity leave and continue to be paid by the business concern.\n\n(3) In general, the following are not considered employees:\n\n(i) Individuals who are not owners and receive no compensation for work performed;\n\n(ii) Individuals who receive deferred compensation for work performed;\n\n(iii) Independent contractors to whom payments are reported via IRS Form 1099 and who are not otherwise considered employees under SBA's Size Policy Statement No. 1; and\n\n(iv) Subcontractors.\n\n(4) Employees of an affiliate may be considered employees, if the totality of the circumstances shows that there is no clear line of fracture between the HUBZone applicant (or certified HUBZone small business concern) and its affiliate(s) (see § 126.204).\n\n(5) An individual must perform work for the concern to be considered an employee for HUBZone purposes. SBA may require evidence that an individual is performing work, including but not limited to the following: a job description; the individual's resume; timesheets; proof of onboarding and/or training; evidence of regular communication assigning work to the individual and responses to such communication; examples of work product commensurate with hours worked; documentation demonstrating the individual's participation in online or telephonic meetings with supervisors or colleagues, such as meeting invitations, notes from meetings, post-meeting questions or assignments; written attestations; and other relevant documentation.\n\nGovernor-Designated Covered Area means an area that SBA has designated as a HUBZone by approving a Governor-generated petition pursuant to the procedures described in § 126.104.\n\nHUBZone means a historically underutilized business zone, which is an area located within one or more:\n\n(1) Qualified census tracts;\n\n(2) Qualified non-metropolitan counties;\n\n(3) Lands within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation;\n\n(4) Redesignated areas;\n\n(5) Qualified base closure areas;\n\n(6) Qualified disaster areas; or\n\n(7) Governor-designated covered areas.\n\nHUBZone certification date means the date on which SBA approves a concern's application for HUBZone certification and is the date specified in the concern's certification letter. If a concern leaves the HUBZone program and reapplies for certification, its HUBZone certification date is the date SBA approves the concern's most recent application.\n\nHUBZone Map means a publicly accessible online tool that depicts HUBZones.\n\nHUBZone resident employee means an individual who meets the definition of an employee and who SBA has determined resides in a HUBZone.\n\nHUBZone small business concern or certified HUBZone small business concern means a small business concern that meets the requirements described in § 126.200 and that SBA has certified as eligible for Federal contracting assistance under the HUBZone program.\n\nIndian reservation (1) Has the same meaning as the term “Indian country” in 18 U.S.C. 1151, except that such term does not include:\n\n(i) Any lands that are located within a State in which a tribe did not exercise governmental jurisdiction as of December 21, 2000, unless that tribe is recognized after that date by either an Act of Congress or pursuant to regulations of the Secretary of the Interior for the administrative recognition that an Indian group exists as an Indian tribe (25 CFR part 83); and\n\n(ii) Lands taken into trust or acquired by an Indian tribe after December 21, 2000 if such lands are not located within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation or former reservation or are not contiguous to the lands held in trust or restricted status as of December 21, 2000; and\n\n(2) In the State of Oklahoma, means lands that:\n\n(i) Are within the jurisdictional areas of an Oklahoma Indian tribe (as determined by the Secretary of the Interior); and\n\n(ii) Are recognized by the Secretary of the Interior as of December 21, 2000, as eligible for trust land status under 25 CFR part 151.\n\nIndian Tribal Government means the governing body of any Indian Tribe, band, nation, pueblo, or other organized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, or is recognized as such by the State in which the Tribe, band, nation, group, or community resides.\n\nInterested party means any certified HUBZone small business concern that submits an offer for a specific HUBZone set-aside contract (including a multiple award contract) or order, any concern that submitted an offer in full and open competition and its opportunity for award will be affected by a price evaluation preference given to a certified HUBZone small business concern or by a reserve of an award given to a certified HUBZone small business concern, the contracting activity's contracting officer, or SBA.\n\nLands within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation include all lands within the perimeter of an Indian reservation, whether tribally owned and governed or not. For example, land that is individually owned and located within the perimeter of an Indian reservation is “lands within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation.” By contrast, an Indian-owned parcel of land that is located outside the perimeter of an Indian reservation is not “lands within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation.”\n\nNative Hawaiian Organization (NHO) means any community service organization serving Native Hawaiians in the State of Hawaii which is a not-for-profit organziation chartered by the State of Hawaii, is controlled by Native Hawaiians, and whose business activities will principally benefit such Native Hawaiians.\n\nNon-metropolitan has the meaning used by the Bureau of the Census, United States Department of Commerce, in its publication titled, “1990 Census of Population, Social and Economic Characteristics,” Report Number CP-2, page A-9. This publication is available for inspection at any local Federal Depository Library. For the location of a Federal Depository Library, call toll-free (888) 293-6498 or contact the Bureau of the Census, Population Distribution Branch, Population Division, Washington D.C. 20233-8800.\n\nPerson means a natural person.\n\nPrimary industry classification or primary industry means the six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code designation which best describes the primary business activity of the HUBZone applicant or certified HUBZone small business concern. SBA utilizes § 121.107 of this chapter in determining a concern's primary industry classification.\n\nPrincipal Office means the location where the greatest number of the concern's employees at any one location perform their work.\n\n(1) In order for a location to be considered the principal office, the concern must provide a deed or an active lease that includes a start date that was at least 30 calendar days prior to the relevant date of review, and an end date that is at least 60 calendar days after the relevant date of review, as well as any other documentation requested by SBA;\n\n(2) In order for a location to be considered the principal office, the concern must conduct business at this location. The concern may be required to demonstrate that it is doing so by submitting evidence including but not limited to the following:\n\n(i) Photos and/or a live or virtual walk-through of the space; and\n\n(ii) For shared working spaces, evidence that the firm has dedicated space within any shared location, and that such dedicated space contains sufficient work surface area, furniture, and equipment to accommodate the number of employees claimed to work from this location;\n\n(3) If an employee works at multiple locations, then the employee will be deemed to work at the location where the employee spends more than 50% of his or her time. If an employee does not spend more than 50% of his or her time at any one location and at least one of those locations is a non-HUBZone location, then the employee will be deemed to work at a non-HUBZone location.\n\n(4) For those concerns whose “primary industry classification” is services or construction (see § 121.201 of this chapter), the determination of principal office excludes the concern's employees who perform more than 50% of their work at job-site locations to fulfill specific contract obligations. If all of a concern's employees perform more than 50% of their work at job sites, the concern does not comply with the principal office requirement.\n\n(i) Example 1. A business concern whose primary industry is construction has a total of 78 employees, including the owners. The business concern has one office (Office A), which is located in a HUBZone, with 3 employees working at that location. The business concern also has a job-site for a current contract, where 75 employees perform more than 50% of their work. The 75 job-site employees are excluded for purposes of determining principal office. Since the remaining 3 employees all work at Office A, Office A is the concern's principal office. Since Office A is in a HUBZone, the business concern complies with the principal office requirement.\n\n(ii) Example 2. A business concern whose primary industry is services has a total of 4 employees, including the owner. The business concern has one office located in a HUBZone (Office A), where 2 employees perform more than 50% of their work, and a second office not located in a HUBZone (Office B), where 2 employees perform more than 50% of their work. Since there is not one location where the greatest number of the concern's employees at any one location perform their work, the business concern would not have a principal office in a HUBZone.\n\n(iii) Example 3. A business concern whose primary industry is services has a total of 6 employees, including the owner. Five of the employees perform all of their work at job-sites fulfilling specific contract obligations. The business concern's owner performs 45% of her work at job-sites, and 55% of her work at an office located in a HUBZone (Office A) conducting tasks such as writing proposals, generating payroll, and responding to emails. Office A would be considered the principal office of the concern since it is the only location where any employees of the concern work that is not a job site and the 1 individual working there spends more than 50% of her time at Office A. Since Office A is located in a HUBZone, the small business concern would meet the principal office requirement.\n\nQualified base closure area means a base closure area that is treated by SBA as a HUBZone for a period of at least 8 years, beginning on the date on which the Administrator designates the base closure area as a HUBZone and ending on the date on which the base closure area ceases to be a qualified census tract or a qualified nonmetropolitan county in accordance with the online tool prepared by the Administrator.\n\nQualified census tract. (1) Qualified census tract means a census tract which is designated by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and for the most recent year for which census data are available on household income in such tract, either in which 50 percent or more of the households have an income which is less than 60 percent of the area median gross income for such year or which has a poverty rate of at least 25 percent. See 26 U.S.C. 42(d)(5)(B)(ii)(I).\n\n(2) The portion of a metropolitan statistical area (as defined by the Bureau of the Census, United States Department of Commerce, in its publications on the Census of Population, Social and Economic Characteristics) which may be designated as “qualified census tracts” shall not exceed an area having 20 percent of the population of such metropolitan statistical area. See 26 U.S.C. 42(d)(5)(B)(ii)(II). This paragraph does not apply to any metropolitan statistical area in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico until December 22, 2027, or the date on which the Financial Oversight and Management Board for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico created by the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) (Pub. L. 114-187, June 30, 2016) ceases to exist, whichever event occurs first.\n\nQualified Disaster Area. (1) Qualified Disaster Area means any census tract or non-metropolitan county located in an area where a major disaster declared by the President under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170) has occurred or an area in which a catastrophic incident has occurred if such census tract or non-metropolitan county ceased to be a Qualified Census Tract or Qualified Non-Metropolitan County during the period beginning 5 years before the date on which the President declared the major disaster or the catastrophic incident occurred.\n\n(2) A census tract or non-metropolitan county shall be considered to be a Qualified Disaster Area for the period of time starting on the date on which the President declared the major disaster for the area in which the census tract or non-metropolitan county, as applicable, is located (or in the case of a catastrophic incident, on the date on which the catastrophic incident occurred in the area in which the census tract or non-metropolitan county, as applicable, is located) and ending on the date when SBA next updates the HUBZone Map in accordance with § 126.104(a).\n\nQualified non-metropolitan county means any county that was not located in a metropolitan statistical area (as defined by the Bureau of the Census, United States Department of Commerce, in its publications on the Census of Population, Social and Economic Characteristics) at the time of the most recent census taken for purposes of selecting qualified census tracts under section 26 U.S.C. 42(d)(5)(B)(ii), and in which:\n\n(1) The median household income is less than 80% of the State median household income, based on a 5-year average of the available data from the Bureau of the Census of the Department of Commerce;\n\n(2) The unemployment rate is not less than 140% of the average unemployment rate for the United States or for the State in which such county is located, whichever is less, based on a 5-year average of the data available from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics report, produced by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics; or\n\n(3) There is located a Difficult Development Area within Alaska, Hawaii, or any territory or possession of the United States outside the 48 contiguous States. A Difficult Development Area (DDA) is an area designated by the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, in accordance with section 26 U.S.C. 42(d)(5)(B)(iii), with high construction, land, and utility costs relative to its area median gross income.\n\nRecertification (or certification renewal), for purposes of this subpart, means the process by which a concern represents that it continues to meet the requirements of the HUBZone program.\n\nRedesignated Area means any census tract that ceases to be a Qualified Census Tract or any non-metropolitan county that ceases to be a Qualified Non-Metropolitan County. A Redesignated Area generally shall be treated as a HUBZone for a period of three years, starting from the date on which the area ceased to be a Qualified Census Tract or a Qualified Non-Metropolitan County. The date on which the census tract or non-metropolitan county ceases to be qualified is the date on which the official government data affecting the eligibility of the HUBZone is released to the public.\n\nReside means to live at a location full-time and for at least 90 calendar days immediately prior to the relevant date of review.\n\n(1) To determine residence, SBA will first look to an individual's address identified on his or her driver's license or other government-issued identification card. Where such documentation is not available (or where the address on the individual's driver's license does not match the residence claimed), SBA will require other specific proof of residency, such as deeds, leases, and/or utility bills, as well as an explanation as to why a driver's license is unavailable or inconsistent.\n\n(2) For HUBZone purposes, SBA will consider individuals temporarily residing overseas in connection with the performance of a contract to reside at their U.S. residence.\n\n(i) Example 1. A person possesses the deed to a residential property and pays utilities and property taxes for that property. However, the person does not live at this property, but instead rents out this property to another individual. For HUBZone purposes, the person does not reside at the address listed on the deed and is not considered a HUBZone employee.\n\n(ii) Example 2. A person moves into an apartment under a month-to-month lease and lives in that apartment full-time. SBA would consider the person to reside at the address listed on the lease if the person can show that he or she has lived at that address for at least 90 calendar days immediately prior to the relevant date of review.\n\n(iii) Example 3. A person is working overseas on a contract for the small business and is therefore temporarily living abroad. The employee can provide documents showing he has paid rent for an apartment located in a HUBZone for at least 90 calendar days immediately prior to the relevant date of review. That person is deemed to reside in a HUBZone.\n\nSmall agricultural cooperative means an association (corporate or otherwise), comprised exclusively of other small agricultural cooperatives, small business concerns, or U.S. citizens, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1141j, whose size does not exceed the applicable size standard pursuant to part 121 of this chapter. In determining such size, an agricultural cooperative is treated as a “business concern” and its member shareholders are not considered affiliated with the cooperative by virtue of their membership in the cooperative.\n\nSmall business concern means a concern that, with its affiliates, meets the size standard corresponding to any NAICS code listed in its profile in the System for Award Management (or successor system), pursuant to part 121 of this chapter.\n\nSystem for Award Management (SAM) has the same meaning as in FAR 2.101.\n\n[63 FR 31908, June 11, 1998, as amended at 66 FR 4645, Jan. 18, 2001; 69 FR 29421, May 24, 2004; 70 FR 51248, Aug. 30, 2005; 72 FR 50041, Aug. 30, 2007; 74 FR 45754, Sept. 4, 2009; 74 FR 56702, Nov. 3, 2009; 78 FR 61144, Oct. 2, 2013; 81 FR 51313, Aug. 4, 2016; 82 FR 48904, Oct. 23, 2017; 84 FR 62449, Nov. 15, 2019; 84 FR 65239, Nov. 26, 2019; 86 FR 23864, May 5, 2021; 88 FR 21088, Apr. 10, 2023; 89 FR 96093, Dec. 4, 2024; 89 FR 102495, Dec. 17, 2024; 90 FR 9674, Feb. 18, 2025]",

    "content": "(a) Petition. Each calendar year, the Governor of a State may submit a petition to the SBA Office of the HUBZone Program requesting that certain covered areas be designated as Governor-designated covered areas. For a specific covered area to receive a designation as a Governor-designated covered area, the Governor of the State in which the identified covered area is wholly contained shall include such area in a petition to SBA requesting such a designation.\n\n(1) A Governor may submit not more than one petition described in this section per calendar year.\n\n(2) The petition described in this section shall include all covered areas in a State for which the Governor seeks designation as a Governor-designated covered area. The total number of covered areas included in such petition may not exceed ten percent of the total number of covered areas in the State.\n\n(3)(i) The total number of covered areas in a State shall be calculated by aggregating the number of census tracts and counties that qualify as covered areas as described in paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(ii) A petition need not seek SBA approval for those covered areas previously designated as Governor-designated covered areas.\n\n(b) SBA Review. In reviewing a request for designation included in such a petition, SBA may consider:\n\n(1) The potential for job creation and investment in the covered area;\n\n(2) The demonstrated interest of small business concerns in the covered area to be designated as a Governor-designated covered area;\n\n(3) How State and local government officials have incorporated the covered area into an economic development strategy; and\n\n(4) If the covered area was a HUBZone before becoming the subject of the petition, the impact on the covered area if the Administrator did not approve the petition.\n\n(c) SBA Decision. The AA/GCBD (or designee) is authorized to grant the petitions described in this section. If the AA/GCBD (or designee) grants a petition described in this section, SBA will issue a written notice to the petitioning Governor and add the newly designated Governor-designated covered areas to the HUBZone Map.\n\n(d) Length of designation. A Governor-designated covered area will be treated as a HUBZone until SBA next updates the HUBZone Map in accordance with § 126.105(a), or one year after the petition is approved, whichever is later.\n\n(e) Definitions. In this section:\n\n(1) The term “covered area” means a census tract or county in a State—\n\n(i) That is located outside of an urban area, as determined by the Bureau of the Census, with a population of not more than 50,000; and\n\n(ii) For which the average unemployment rate is at least 120 percent of the average unemployment rate of the United States or of the State in which the covered area is located, whichever is less, based on the most recent data available from the American Community Survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census.\n\n(2) The term “Governor” means the chief executive of a State.\n\n(3) The term “State” means each of the States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or American Samoa.\n\n[89 FR 102497, Dec. 17, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) Ownership. In order to be eligible for HUBZone certification and to remain certified, a small business concern must be owned in accordance with this paragraph. The concern must be:\n\n(1) At least 51% owned and controlled by one or more individuals who are United States citizens;\n\n(2) An ANC or at least 51% owned by an ANC or a wholly-owned business entity of an ANC;\n\n(3) At least 51% owned by one or more Indian Tribal Governments, or by a corporation that is wholly owned by one or more Indian Tribal Governments;\n\n(4) At least 51% owned by one or more CDCs;\n\n(5) A small agricultural cooperative organized or incorporated in the United States, or at least 51% owned by one or more small agricultural cooperatives organized or incorporated in the United States; or\n\n(6) At least 51% owned by one or more NHOs, or by a corporation that is wholly owned by one or more NHOs.\n\n(b) Size. (1) In order to be eligible for HUBZone certification and recertification, a concern, together with its affiliates, must qualify as a small business concern as defined in part 121 of this chapter under the size standard corresponding to any NAICS code listed in its profile in SAM (or successor system). In determining whether a concern qualifies as small under the size standard corresponding to a specific NAICS code, SBA will accept the concern's size representation in SAM (or successor system), unless there is evidence indicating that the concern is other than small. SBA will request a formal size determination pursuant to § 121.1001(b)(8) of this chapter where any information it possesses calls into question the concern's SAM size representation.\n\n(2) In order to be eligible for a HUBZone contract, a certified HUBZone small business concern must qualify as small under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the HUBZone contract.\n\n(3) If the concern is a small agricultural cooperative, in determining size, the small agricultural cooperative is treated as a “business concern” and its member shareholders are not considered affiliated with the cooperative by virtue of their membership in the cooperative.\n\n(c) Principal office. In order to be eligible for HUBZone certification, a concern's principal office must be located in a HUBZone, except for concerns owned in whole or in part by one or more Indian Tribal Governments.\n\n(1) Long-term investment—(i) General. A concern that has purchased a building or entered a long-term lease of at least 10 years for a property in a HUBZone (other than in a Redesignated Area or Qualified Disaster Area) will be deemed to have its principal office located in a HUBZone for up to 10 years from the date of the investment, as long as that building or property qualifies as the concern's principal office and continues to qualify as the concern's principal office, and as long as the firm maintains the long-term lease or continues to be the sole owner of the property.\n\n(ii) Commencement of 10-year period. The 10-year principal office long-term investment protection period starts to run on the firm's HUBZone certification date (if the investment was made prior to the firm's certification) or on the date of the investment (if the investment was made after the firm's HUBZone certification date).\n\n(iii) Exceptions. The following do not qualify for this provision:\n\n(A) An office located in a Redesignated Area or Qualified Disaster Area at the time of initial HUBZone certification;\n\n(B) An office that is shared with one or more other concerns or individuals;\n\n(C) Any location being used as a personal residence; or\n\n(D) An investment made within 180 calendar days of the expiration of an area's designation as a Qualified Census Tract, Qualified Non-Metropolitan County, Governor-Designated Covered Area, or Qualified Base Closure Area.\n\n(2) Tribally-owned concerns. A concern that is owned in whole or in part by one or more Indian Tribal Governments (or by a corporation that is wholly owned by Indian Tribal Governments) must either:\n\n(i) Maintain a principal office located in a HUBZone and ensure that at least 35% of its employees reside in a HUBZone as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or\n\n(ii) Certify that when performing a HUBZone contract, at least 35% of its employees engaged in performing that contract will reside within any Indian reservation governed by one or more of the Indian Tribal Government owners, or reside within any HUBZone adjacent to such Indian reservation.\n\n(d) Employees. (1) General. In order to be eligible for HUBZone certification, at least 35% of a concern's employees must qualify as HUBZone resident employees. When determining the percentage of employees that must reside in a HUBZone to meet the 35% HUBZone residency requirement, if the percentage results in a fraction, SBA rounds to the nearest whole number, except for a firm with only one employee. For firms with only one employee, that one employee must reside in a HUBZone.\n\n(2) Tribally-owned concerns. If the concern is owned in whole or in part by one or more Indian Tribal Governments (or by a corporation that is wholly owned by one or more Indian Tribal Governments), see paragraph (c)(2) of this section.\n\n(3) Legacy HUBZone employees. (i) An individual will be considered a Legacy HUBZone Employee and count as a HUBZone resident employee, even if the employee subsequently moves to a location that is not in a HUBZone or the area in which the employee's residence is located no longer qualifies as a HUBZone, if the individual:\n\n(A) Continues to live in a HUBZone for at least 180 calendar days immediately after the firm's HUBZone certification date (or recertification date); and\n\n(B) Continues to meet the definition of “employee” in § 126.103 continuously and without interruption.\n\n(ii) A certified HUBZone small business concern may have up to four Legacy HUBZone Employees at a given time, but must have at least one other HUBZone employee in order for any legacy employee to count as a HUBZone employee.\n\n(iii) The certified HUBZone small business concern must maintain records of the Legacy HUBZone Employee's original HUBZone address, as well as records of any HUBZone other address in which the individual resided, as well as records of the individual's continuous and uninterrupted employment by the HUBZone small business concern, for the duration of the concern's participation in the HUBZone program. In order to demonstrate that an individual resided in a HUBZone for 180 days after certification (or recertification), the concern must submit to SBA copies of leases, utility bills, or property tax records.\n\n(iv) The certification date or recertification date being used to establish the HUBZone residency of the employee must be after December 26, 2019.\n\n(v) The following individuals do not qualify as Legacy HUBZone Employees:\n\n(A) An individual who initially qualified as a HUBZone Resident Employee by residing in a Redesignated Area or a Qualified Disaster Area; and\n\n(B) An individual who works less than 30 hours per week.\n\n(e) Attempt to maintain. (1) At the time of application, each recertification required by § 126.500(a), and offer for a HUBZone contract, a concern must certify that it will “attempt to maintain” (see § 126.103) having at least 35% of its employees reside in a HUBZone during the performance of any HUBZone contract it receives.\n\n(2) At the time of recertification, a firm that is currently performing a HUBZone contract and falls below the 35% HUBZone residency requirement may recertify as a HUBZone small business concern as long as at least 20% of its total employees reside in a HUBZone and it is making substantive and documented efforts to meet the HUBZone residency requirement.\n\n(3) During performance of a HUBZone contract, a HUBZone small business concern must attempt to maintain having at least 35% of its employees residing in HUBZones.\n\n(f) Suspension and Debarment. At the time of application and at all times while a concern is HUBZone-certified, such concern and any of its owners must not have an active exclusion in SAM.\n\n(g) Federal financial obligations. A business concern is ineligible to be certified as a HUBZone small business concern or to participate in the HUBZone program if either the concern or any of its principals has failed to pay significant financial obligations owed to the Federal Government, including unresolved tax liens and defaults on Federal loans or other Federally assisted financing. However, a small business concern may be eligible if the concern or the affected principals can demonstrate that they are current on an approved repayment plan, or the financial obligations owed have been settled and discharged/forgiven by the Federal Government.\n\n[84 FR 65242, Nov. 26, 2019, as amended at 86 FR 61673, Nov. 8, 2021; 88 FR 26212, Apr. 27, 2023; 89 FR 102498, Dec. 17, 2024; 90 FR 9675, Feb. 18, 2025]",

(1) SBA may request documents to verify that the applicant meets the HUBZone program's eligibility requirements. The documents must show that the concern meets the program's requirements at the time it submits its application to SBA.\n\n(2) The concern must document compliance with the requirements listed in § 126.200, including but not limited to employment records and documentation showing the address of each HUBZone resident employee. Records sufficient to demonstrate HUBZone residency include copies of driver's licenses and voter registration cards; only where such documentation is unavailable will SBA accept alternative documentation (such as copies of leases, deeds, and/or utility bills) accompanied by signed statements explaining why the alternative documentation is being provided.\n\n(c) Changes after submission of application.

In order to recertify—\n\n(i) A certified HUBZone small business concern that was not awarded a HUBZone contract during the 12-month period preceding its recertification must represent that, at the time of its recertification, at least 35% of its employees reside in HUBZones and the concern's principal office is located in a HUBZone.\n\n(ii) A certified HUBZone small business concern that was awarded a HUBZone contract during the 12-month period preceding its recertification must represent that, at the time of its recertification, it is attempting to maintain compliance with the 35% HUBZone residency requirement and the concern's principal office is located in a HUBZone.\n\n(2) The concern's recertification must be submitted in the 90 calendar days before the triennial anniversary of its HUBZone certification date.\n\n(3) If a concern fails to recertify, SBA will decertify the concern at the end of its eligibility period. However, if a concern is able to recertify its eligibility within 30 days of the end of its eligibility period, SBA will reinstate the firm as a certified HUBZone small business concern.\n\n(4) For a certified HUBZone small business concern that is also a certified WOSB or SDVOSB, the firm may have to recertify less than three years after its previous recertification in order to align certification date.\n\n(b) Program examinations.

    "content": "(a) Proposed decertification—(1) Bases for proposed decertification. SBA may propose a certified HUBZone small business concern for decertification from the HUBZone program if:\n\n(i) SBA has found the concern to be ineligible based on a program examination;\n\n(ii) The concern failed to respond to a program examination;\n\n(iii) SBA has information indicating that the concern is performing a HUBZone but is not attempting to maintain (see § 126.103) compliance with the 35% HUBZone residency requirement; or\n\n(iv) SBA is unable to verify the concern's eligibility or otherwise has information indicating that the concern may not meet the eligibility requirements of this part,\n\n(2) Notice of proposed decertification. SBA will notify the HUBZone small business concern by email that SBA is proposing to decertify it and state the reason(s) for the proposed decertification. The notice of proposed decertification will notify the concern that it has 30 calendar days from the date SBA emails the letter to submit a written response to SBA explaining why the proposed ground(s) should not justify decertification. SBA will consider that written notice was provided if SBA sends the notice of proposed decertification to the concern at the email address provided in the concern's profile in DSBS (or successor system).\n\n(3) Response to notice of proposed decertification. The HUBZone small business concern must submit a written response to the notice of proposed decertification within the timeframe specified in the notice. In this response, the concern must rebut each of the reasons set forth by SBA in the notice of proposed decertification, and where appropriate, the rebuttal must include documents showing that the concern is eligible for the HUBZone program as of the date specified in the notice.\n\n(4) Adverse inference. If a HUBZone small business concern fails to cooperate with SBA or fails to provide the information requested, SBA may draw an adverse inference and assume that the information that the concern failed to provide would demonstrate ineligibility.\n\n(5) SBA's decision. SBA will determine whether the HUBZone small business concern remains eligible for the program within 90 calendar days after receiving all requested information, when practicable. SBA will provide written notice to the concern stating the basis for the determination.\n\n(i) If SBA finds that the concern is not eligible, SBA will decertify the concern and remove its designation as a certified HUBZone small business concern in DSBS (or successor system).\n\n(ii) If SBA finds that the concern is eligible, the concern will continue to be designated as a certified HUBZone small business concern in DSBS (or successor system).\n\n(b) Decertification pursuant to a protest. The procedures described in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to HUBZone status protests. If the D/HUB sustains a protest pursuant to § 126.803, SBA will decertify the HUBZone small business concern immediately and change the concern's status in DSBS (or successor system) to reflect that it no longer qualifies as a certified HUBZone small business concern without first proposing it for decertification.\n\n(c) Decertification based on false or misleading information. (1) If SBA discovers that a certified HUBZone small business concern or its representative submitted false or misleading information, SBA will propose the firm for decertification. In addition, SBA will refer the matter to the SBA Office of Inspector General for review and may recommend that Government-wide debarment or suspension proceedings be initiated.\n\n(2) A firm that is decertified from the HUBZone program due to the submission of false or misleading information may be removed from SBA's other small business contracting programs, including the 8(a) Business Development Program, the Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Program, the Veteran Small Business Certification (VetCert) Program, and SBA's Mentor-Protégé Program.\n\n(3) A firm that is decertified or terminated from the 8(a) BD Program, the WOSB Program, or the VetCert Program due to the submission of false or misleading information may be decertified from the HUBZone Program.\n\n(4) SBA may require a firm that is decertified or terminated from the HUBZone Program, 8(a) BD Program, the WOSB Program, or the VetCert Program due to the submission of false or misleading information to enter into an administrative agreement with SBA as a condition of admission or re-admission to the HUBZone program.\n\n(d) Decertification due to debarment. If a certified HUBZone small business concern is debarred from Federal contracting, SBA will decertify the HUBZone small business concern immediately and change the concern's status in DSBS (or successor system) to reflect that it no longer qualifies as a certified HUBZone small business concern, without first proposing it for decertification.\n\n(e) Effect of decertification. Once SBA has decertified a concern, the concern is ineligible for the HUBZone program and may not submit an offer or quote for a HUBZone contract. If a concern does so, it may be in violation of criminal laws, including section 16(d) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d). If the concern has already certified as a HUBZone small business on a pending procurement, the concern must immediately inform the contracting officer for the procuring agency of the adverse eligibility determination. A contracting officer shall not award a HUBZone contract to a concern that the D/HUB has determined is not an eligible HUBZone small business concern for the procurement in question.\n\n[84 FR 65246, Nov. 26, 2019, as amended at 88 FR 26212, Apr. 27, 2023; 89 FR 102501, Dec. 17, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. (1) Where a contracting officer will award a contract on the basis of full and open competition, the contracting officer must deem the price offered by a certified HUBZone small business concern to be lower than the price offered by an offeror that is not a small business concern if: the other than small business initially is the lowest responsive and responsible offeror, and the price offered by the certified HUBZone small business concern is not more than 10% higher than the price offered by the other than small business.\n\n(2) The HUBZone price evaluation preference does not apply where the initial lowest responsive and responsible offeror is a small business concern.\n\n(3) The HUBZone price evaluation preference does not apply to the portion of a multiple award contract that is reserved for certified HUBZone small business concerns. However, the HUBZone price evaluation preference does apply to the non-reserved portion of a multiple award contract.\n\n(4) To apply the HUBZone price evaluation preference, the contracting officer must add 10% to the offer of the otherwise successful other than small business offeror. If the certified HUBZone small business concern's offer is lower than that of the other than small business after the preference is applied, the certified HUBZone small business concern must be deemed the lowest-priced offeror. For a best value procurement, the contracting officer must first apply the 10% price preference to the offers of any other than small businesses and then determine which offeror represents the best value to the Government, in accordance with the terms of the solicitation. Where, after considering the price evaluation adjustment, the offer of a certified HUBZone small business concern is determined to be the best value to the Government, award shall be made to the certified HUBZone small business concern.\n\n(b) Agricultural commodities. (1) For purchases by the Secretary of Agriculture of agricultural commodities, the price evaluation preferences shall be:\n\n(i) 10%, for the portion of a contract to be awarded that is not greater than 25% of the total volume being procured for each commodity in a single invitation for bids (IFB);\n\n(ii) 5%, for the portion of a contract to be awarded that is greater than 25%, but not greater than 40%, of the total volume being procured for each commodity in a single IFB; and\n\n(iii) Zero, for the portion of a contract to be awarded that is greater than 40% of the total volume being procured for each commodity in a single IFB.\n\n(2) The 10% and 5% price evaluation preferences for agricultural commodities apply to all offers from certified HUBZone small business concerns up to the 25% and 40% volume limits specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. As such, more than one certified HUBZone small business concern may receive a price evaluation preference for any given commodity in a single IFB.\n\n(i) Example:\n\nThere is an IFB for 100,000 pounds of wheat. Bid 1 (from a large business) is $1/pound for 100,000 pounds of wheat. Bid 2 (from a HUBZone small business concern) is $1.05/pound for 20,000 pounds of wheat. Bid 3 (from a HUBZone small business concern) is $1.04/pound for 20,000 pounds. Bid 3 receives a 10% price evaluation adjustment for 20,000 pounds, since 20,000 is less than 25% of 100,000 pounds. With the 10% price evaluation adjustment, Bid 1 changes from $20,000 for the first 20,000 pounds to $22,000. Bid 3's price of $20,800 ($1.04 × 20,000) is now lower than any other bid for 20,000 pounds. Thus, Bid 3 will be accepted for the full 20,000 pounds. Bid 2 receives a 10% price evaluation adjustment for that amount of its bid when added to the volume in Bid 3 that does not exceed 25% of the total volume being procured. Since 25,000 pounds is 25% of the total volume of wheat under the IFB, and Bid 3 totaled 20,000 pounds, a 10% price evaluation adjustment will be applied to the first 5,000 pounds of Bid 2. With the price evaluation adjustment, the price for Bid 1, as measured against Bid 2, for 5,000 pounds changes from $5,000 to $5,500. Bid 2's price of $5,250 ($1.05 × 5,000) is lower than Bid 1 for 5,000 pounds. Bid 2 will then receive a 5% price evaluation adjustment for the remaining 15,000 pounds, since the total volume of Bids 3 and 2 receiving an adjustment does not exceed 40% of the total volume of wheat under the IFB (i.e., 40,000 pounds). With the 5% price evaluation adjustment, Bid 1's price for the next 15,000 pounds changes from $15,000 to $15,750. Bid 2's price for that 15,000 pounds is also $15, 750 ($1.05 × 15,000). Because the evaluation price for Bid 2 is not more than 10% higher than the price offered by Bid 1, Bid 2's price is deemed to be lower than the price offered by Bid 1. Since the evaluation price for both the first 5,000 pounds (receiving a 10% price evaluation adjustment) and the remaining 15,000 pounds (receiving a 5% price evaluation adjustment) is less than Bid 1, Bid 2 will be accepted for the full 20,000 pounds.\n\n(ii) [Reserved]\n\n(c) International food aid operations. For purchases by the Secretary of Agriculture of agricultural commodities for export operations through international food aid programs administered by the Farm Service Agency, the price evaluation preference shall be 5% on the first portion of a contract to be awarded that is not greater than 20% of the total volume being procured for each commodity in a single IFB.\n\n(d) Not treated as partial set-aside. A contract awarded to a certified HUBZone small business concern under a preference described in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be counted toward the fulfillment of any requirement partially set aside for competition restricted to small business concerns.\n\n(e) Applicability to HUBZone joint ventures. The HUBZone price evaluation preference applies only to a joint venture consisting of a certified HUBZone small business concern and a small business concern that complies with the requirements of § 125.9. The HUBZone price evaluation preference does not apply to a joint venture consisting of a certified HUBZone small business concern and its other than small mentor.\n\n[69 FR 29425, May 24, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 51250, Aug. 30, 2005; 78 FR 61146, Oct. 2, 2013; 84 FR 65248, Nov. 26, 2019; 89 FR 102503, Dec. 17, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. A certified HUBZone small business concern may enter into a joint venture agreement with one or more other small business concerns, or with an SBA-approved mentor authorized by § 125.9 of this chapter, for the purpose of submitting an offer for a HUBZone contract.\n\n(1) SBA does not certify HUBZone joint ventures, but the joint venture should be designated as a HUBZone joint venture in SAM (or successor system) with the HUBZone-certified joint venture partner identified.\n\n(2) A certified HUBZone small business concern cannot be a joint venture partner on more than one joint venture that submits an offer for a specific contract or order set-aside or reserved for certified HUBZone small business concerns.\n\n(b) Size. (1) A joint venture of at least one certified HUBZone small business concern and one or more other business concerns may submit an offer as a small business for a HUBZone procurement or sale so long as each concern is small under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the procurement or sale.\n\n(2) A joint venture between a protégé firm and its SBA-approved mentor (see § 125.9 of this chapter) will be deemed small provided the protégé qualifies as small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the HUBZone procurement or sale.\n\n(c) Contents of joint venture agreement. Every joint venture agreement to perform a HUBZone contract, including those between a protégé firm that is a certified HUBZone small business concern and its SBA-approved mentor authorized by § 124.520 or § 125.9 of this chapter, must contain a provision:\n\n(1) Setting forth the purpose of the joint venture;\n\n(2) Designating a certified HUBZone small business concern as the managing venturer of the joint venture, and designating a named employee of the certified HUBZone small business managing venturer as the manager with ultimate responsibility for performance of the contract (the “Responsible Manager”).\n\n(i) The managing venturer is responsible for controlling the day-to-day management and administration of the contractual performance of the joint venture, but other partners to the joint venture may participate in all corporate governance activities and decisions of the joint venture as is commercially customary.\n\n(ii) The individual identified as the Responsible Manager of the joint venture need not be an employee of the certified HUBZone small business concern at the time the joint venture submits an offer, but, if he or she is not, there must be a signed letter of intent that the individual commits to be employed by the certified HUBZone small business concern if the joint venture is the successful offeror. The individual identified as the Responsible Manager cannot be employed by the mentor and become an employee of the certified HUBZone small business concern for purposes of performance under the joint venture.\n\n(iii) Although the joint venture managers responsible for orders issued under an IDIQ contract need not be employees of the protégé, those managers must report to and be supervised by the joint venture's Responsible Manager.\n\n(3) Stating that with respect to a separate legal entity joint venture, the certified HUBZone small business concern must own at least 51% of the joint venture entity;\n\n(4) Stating that the certified HUBZone small business concern must receive profits from the joint venture commensurate with the work performed by the certified HUBZone small business concern, or a percentage agreed to by the parties to the joint venture whereby the certified HUBZone small business concern receives profits from the joint venture that exceed the percentage commensurate with the work performed by the certified HUBZone small business concern;\n\n(5) Providing for the establishment and administration of a special bank account in the name of the joint venture. This account must require the signature or consent of all parties to the joint venture for any payments made by the joint venture to its members for services performed. All payments due the joint venture for performance on a HUBZone contract will be deposited in the special account; all expenses incurred under the contract will be paid from the account as well;\n\n(6) Itemizing all major equipment, facilities, and other resources to be furnished by each party to the joint venture, with a detailed schedule of cost or value of each, where practical. If a contract is indefinite in nature, such as an indefinite quantity contract or a multiple award contract where the level of effort or scope of work is not known, the joint venture must provide a general description of the anticipated major equipment, facilities, and other resources to be furnished by each party to the joint venture, without a detailed schedule of cost or value of each, or in the alternative, specify how the parties to the joint venture will furnish such resources to the joint venture once a definite scope of work is made publicly available;\n\n(7) Specifying the responsibilities of the parties with regard to negotiation of the contract, source of labor, and contract performance, including ways that the parties to the joint venture will ensure that the joint venture and the HUBZone partner(s) to the joint venture will meet the limitations on subcontracting requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, where practical. If a contract is indefinite in nature, such as an indefinite quantity contract or a multiple award contract where the level of effort or scope of work is not known, the joint venture must provide a general description of the anticipated responsibilities of the parties with regard to negotiation of the contract, source of labor, and contract performance, not including the ways that the parties to the joint venture will ensure that the joint venture and the HUBZone partner(s) to the joint venture will meet the limitations on subcontracting requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, or in the alternative, specify how the parties to the joint venture will define such responsibilities once a definite scope of work is made publicly available;\n\n(8) Obligating all parties to the joint venture to ensure performance of the HUBZone contract and to complete performance despite the withdrawal of any member;\n\n(9) Designating that accounting and other administrative records relating to the joint venture be kept in the office of the certified HUBZone small business concern managing venturer, unless approval to keep them elsewhere is granted by the District Director or his/her designee upon written request;\n\n(10) Requiring that the final original records be retained by the certified HUBZone small business concern managing venturer upon completion of the HUBZone contract performed by the joint venture;\n\n(11) Stating that quarterly financial statements showing cumulative contract receipts and expenditures (including salaries of the joint venture's principals) must be submitted to SBA not later than 45 days after each operating quarter of the joint venture; and\n\n(12) Stating that a project-end profit and loss statement, including a statement of final profit distribution, must be submitted to SBA no later than 90 days after completion of the contract.\n\n(d) Limitations on subcontracting. (1) For any HUBZone contract to be performed by a joint venture between a certified HUBZone small business concern and another certified HUBZone small business concern, the aggregate of the certified HUBZone small business concerns to the joint venture, not each concern separately, must perform the applicable percentage of work required by § 125.6 of this chapter.\n\n(2) For any HUBZone contract to be performed by a joint venture between a certified HUBZone small business concern and a small business concern or its SBA-approved mentor authorized by § 125.9 or § 124.520 of this chapter, the joint venture must perform the applicable percentage of work required by § 125.6 of this chapter, and the certified HUBZone small business concern partner to the joint venture must perform at least 40% of the work performed by the joint venture.\n\n(i) The work performed by the certified HUBZone small business concern partner to a joint venture must be more than administrative or ministerial functions so that it gains substantive experience.\n\n(ii) The amount of work done by the partners will be aggregated and the work done by the certified HUBZone small business concern partner must be at least 40% of the total done by the partners. In determining the amount of work done by a mentor participating in a joint venture with a HUBZone qualified protégé, all work done by the mentor and any of its affiliates at any subcontracting tier will be counted.\n\n(e) Certification of compliance—(1) At time of offer. If submitting an offer as a joint venture for a HUBZone contract, at the time of initial offer (and if applicable, final offer), each certified HUBZone small business concern joint venture partner must make the following certifications to the contracting officer separately under its own name:\n\n(i) It is a certified HUBZone small business concern that appears in DSBS (or successor system) as a certified HUBZone small business concern and it meets the eligibility requirements in § 126.200;\n\n(ii) It, together with its affiliates, is small under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the procurement;\n\n(iii) It will “attempt to maintain” having at least 35% of its employees residing in a HUBZone during performance of the contract; and\n\n(iv) It will comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting during performance of the contract, as set forth in § 125.6 of this chapter and §§ 126.200(f) and 126.700.\n\n(2) Prior to performance. Prior to the performance of any HUBZone contract as a joint venture, the HUBZone small business concern partner to the joint venture must submit a written certification to the contracting officer and SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, stating the following:\n\n(i) The parties have entered into a joint venture agreement that fully complies with paragraph (c) of this section; and\n\n(ii) The parties will perform the contract in compliance with the joint venture agreement.\n\n(f) Capabilities, past performance, and experience. When evaluating the capabilities, past performance, experience, business systems, and certifications of an entity submitting an offer for a HUBZone contract as a joint venture established pursuant to this section, a procuring activity must consider work done and qualifications held individually by each partner to the joint venture as well as any work done by the joint venture itself previously. A procuring activity may not require the HUBZone small business concern to individually meet the same evaluation or responsibility criteria as that required of other offerors generally. The partners to the joint venture in the aggregate must demonstrate the past performance, experience, business systems, and certifications necessary to perform the contract.\n\n(g) Contract execution. The procuring activity will execute a HUBZone contract in the name of the joint venture entity or the certified HUBZone small business concern, but in either case will identify the award as one to a HUBZone joint venture or a HUBZone mentor-protégé joint venture, as appropriate.\n\n(h) Inspection of records. The joint venture partners must allow SBA's authorized representatives, including representatives authorized by the SBA Inspector General, during normal business hours, access to its files to inspect and copy all records and documents relating to the joint venture.\n\n(i) Limitations on subcontracting reports. The certified HUBZone small business concern partner to a joint venture must describe how it is meeting or has met the applicable limitations on subcontracting requirements for each HUBZone contract it performs as a joint venture.\n\n(1) The certified HUBZone small business concern partner to the joint venture must annually submit a report to the relevant contracting officer and to the SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, explaining how the limitations on subcontracting requirements are being met for each HUBZone contract performed during the year.\n\n(2) At the completion of every HUBZone contract awarded to a joint venture, the certified HUBZone small business concern partner to the joint venture must submit a report to the relevant contracting officer and to the SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, explaining how and certifying that the limitations on subcontracting requirements were met for the contract, and further certifying that the contract was performed in accordance with the provisions of the joint venture agreement that are required under paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(j) Basis for suspension or debarment. The Government may consider the following as a ground for suspension or debarment as a willful violation of a regulatory provision or requirement applicable to a public agreement or transaction:\n\n(1) Failure to enter a joint venture agreement that complies with paragraph (c) of this section;\n\n(2) Failure to perform a contract in accordance with the joint venture agreement or limitations on subcontracting requirements in paragraph (d) of this section; or\n\n(3) Failure to submit the certification required by paragraph (e) of this section or comply with paragraph (h) of this section.\n\n(k) Any person with information concerning a joint venture's compliance with the limitations on subcontracting requirements may report that information to SBA and/or the SBA Office of Inspector General.\n\n(l) Non-HUBZone contracts. On a non-HUBZone contract, for an award to a joint venture to be considered awarded to a certified HUBZone small business concern (i.e., for a procuring agency to receive HUBZone credit for goaling purposes), the joint venture awardee must comply with the requirements of this section and § 125.8.\n\n[81 FR 48591, July 25, 2016, as amended at 81 FR 94942, Dec. 27, 2016; 83 FR 12852, Mar. 26, 2018; 84 FR 65248, Nov. 29, 2019; 85 FR 66197, Oct. 16, 2020; 86 FR 2959, Jan. 14, 2021; 88 FR 26212, Apr. 27, 2023; 89 FR 102504, Dec. 17, 2024]",

For an order that is set aside for certified HUBZone small business concerns against a Multiple Award Contract with a HUBZone reserve, a certified HUBZone small business concern must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting (see § 125.6 of this chapter), or if applicable, the nonmanufacturer rule (see § 121.406 of this chapter), in the performance of such order. However, the certified HUBZone small business concern does not have to comply with the limitations on subcontracting or the nonmanufacturer rule for any order issued against the Multiple Award Contract if the order is competed amongst certified HUBZone small business concerns and one or more other-than-small business concerns.\n\n[84 FR 65249, Nov. 26, 2019, as amended at 86 FR 61673, Nov. 8, 2021]",

    "content": "(a) General. (1) A HUBZone status protest is the process by which an interested party may challenge the HUBZone status of an apparent successful offeror on a HUBZone contract, including a HUBZone joint venture submitting an offer under § 126.616. SBA will also consider a protest challenging whether a HUBZone prime contractor is unduly reliant on a small, non-similarly situated entity subcontractor or if such subcontractor performs the primary and vital requirements of the contract.\n\n(2) The protest procedures described in this part are separate from those governing size protests and appeals. All protests relating to whether a certified HUBZone small business concern is other than small for purposes of any Federal program are subject to part 121 of this chapter and must be filed in accordance with that part. If a protester protests both the size of the HUBZone small business concern and whether the concern meets the HUBZone eligibility requirements set forth in § 126.200, SBA will process the protests concurrently, under the procedures set forth in part 121 of this chapter and this part.\n\n(3) SBA does not review issues concerning the administration of a HUBZone contract.\n\n(b) Format and specificity. (1) Protests must be in writing and must state all specific grounds as to why the protestor believes the protested concern did not qualify as a certified HUBZone small business concern. Specifically, a protestor must explain why:\n\n(i) The protested concern did not meet the HUBZone eligibility requirements set forth in § 126.200;\n\n(ii) The protested joint venture does not meet the requirements set forth in § 126.616;\n\n(iii) The protested concern, as a HUBZone prime contractor, is unduly reliant on one or more small subcontractors that are not HUBZone-certified, or subcontractors that are not HUBZone-certified will perform the primary and vital requirements of the contract; and/or\n\n(iv) The protested concern that was awarded a HUBZone contract during the 12-month period prior to submitting the offer at issue has less than 20% of its total employees that reside in a HUBZone and/or is not making substantive and documented efforts to meet the HUBZone residency requirement.\n\n(2) Specificity requires more than conclusions of ineligibility. A protest merely asserting that the protested concern did not qualify as a HUBZone small business concern, or that it did not meet the principal office and/or 35% residency requirements, without setting forth specific facts or allegations, is insufficient and will be dismissed.\n\n(3) For a protest filed against a HUBZone joint venture, the protest must state all specific grounds as to why:\n\n(i) The HUBZone small business partner to the joint venture did not meet the HUBZone eligibility requirements set forth in § 126.200 at the time of offer; and/or\n\n(ii) The protested HUBZone joint venture does not meet the requirements set forth in § 126.616 as of the date of its final proposal revision.\n\n(4) For a protest alleging that the prime contractor has an ostensible subcontractor, the protest must state all specific grounds as to why:\n\n(i) The protested concern is unduly reliant on one or more small subcontractors that are not HUBZone-certified, or\n\n(ii) One or more subcontractors that are not HUBZone-certified will perform the primary and vital requirements of the contract.\n\n(5) For a protest alleging that the protested concern failed to attempt to maintain compliance with the 35% HUBZone residency requirement during the performance of a HUBZone contract, the protest must state all specific grounds explaining why the protester believes that at least 20% of the protested firm's employees do not reside in a HUBZone and/or that the protested firm has not made any substantive and documented efforts to meet the HUBZone residency requirement.\n\n(c) Filing. (1) An interested party other than a contracting officer or SBA must submit its written protest to the contracting officer.\n\n(2) A contracting officer must submit his/her protest and forward an interested party's protest to SBA at hzprotests@sba.gov.\n\n(d) Timeliness. A protest by an interested party challenging the HUBZone status of an apparent successful offeror on a HUBZone contract must be timely, or it will be dismissed. A protest by a contracting officer or SBA challenging the HUBZone status of an apparent successful offeror on a HUBZone contract or of an awardee on a HUBZone contract is always timely.\n\n(1) For negotiated acquisitions, an interested party must submit its protest by close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the apparent successful offeror.\n\n(i) Except for an order or Blanket Purchase Agreement issued under a Federal Supply Schedule contract, for an order or Agreement that is set-aside for certified HUBZone small business concerns under a multiple award contract that was not itself set aside or reserved for certified HUBZone small business concerns, an interested party must submit its protest by close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the intended awardee of the order or Agreement.\n\n(ii) Where a contracting officer has required offerors for a specific order under a multiple award HUBZone contract to recertify their HUBZone status, an interested party must submit its protest by close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the intended awardee of the order.\n\n(2) For sealed bid acquisitions:\n\n(i) An interested party must submit its protest by close of business on the fifth business day after bid opening, or where the identified low bidder is determined to be ineligible for award, by close of business on the fifth business day after the contracting officer has notified interested parties of the identity of that low bidder, or\n\n(ii) If the price evaluation preference was not applied at the time of bid opening, an interested party must submit its protest by close of business on the fifth business day after the date of identification of the apparent successful low bidder.\n\n(3) Any protest submitted after the time limits is untimely, unless it is from SBA or the CO.\n\n(4) Any protest received prior to bid opening or notification of intended award, whichever applies, is premature.\n\n(e) Referral to SBA. The contracting officer must forward to SBA any non-premature HUBZone status protest received, notwithstanding whether he or she believes it is sufficiently specific or timely. The contracting officer must send the protest, along with a referral letter, to the D/HUB by email to hzprotests@sba.gov.\n\n(1) The contracting officer's referral letter must include information pertaining to the solicitation that may be necessary for SBA to determine timeliness and standing, including the following:\n\n(i) The solicitation number;\n\n(ii) The name, address, telephone number, email address, and facsimile number of the contracting officer;\n\n(iii) The type of HUBZone contract at issue (i.e., HUBZone set-aside; HUBZone sole source; full and open competition with a HUBZone price evaluation preference applied; reserve for HUBZone small business concerns under a Multiple Award Contract; or order set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns against a Multiple Award Contract);\n\n(iv) If the procurement was conducted using full and open competition with a HUBZone price evaluation preference, whether the protester's opportunity for award was affected by the preference;\n\n(v) If the procurement was a HUBZone set-aside, whether the protester submitted an offer;\n\n(vi) Whether the protested concern was the apparent successful offeror;\n\n(vii) Whether the procurement was conducted using sealed bid or negotiated procedures;\n\n(viii) If the procurement was conducted using sealed bid procedures, the bid opening date;\n\n(ix) The date the protester was notified of the apparent successful offeror;\n\n(x) The date the protest was submitted to the contracting officer;\n\n(xi) The date the protested concern submitted its initial offer or bid to the contracting activity; and\n\n(xii) Whether a contract has been awarded, and if applicable, the date of contract award and contract number.\n\n(2) Where a protestor alleges that a certified HUBZone small business concern is unduly reliant on one or more subcontractors that are not certified HUBZone small business concerns or a subcontractor that is not a certified HUBZone small business concern will perform primary and vital requirements of the contract, the D/HUB will refer the matter to the Government Contracting Area Office serving the geographic area in which the principal office of the certified HUBZone small business concern is located for a determination as to whether the ostensible subcontractor rule has been met.\n\n[63 FR 31908, June 11, 1998, as amended at 69 FR 29427, May 24, 2004, 84 FR 65250, Nov. 26, 2019; 84 FR 65665, Nov. 29, 2019; 85 FR 66197, Oct. 16, 2020; 88 FR 26213, Apr. 27, 2023; 89 FR 102504, Dec. 17, 2024]",

(1) SBA immediately will notify the contracting officer and the protestor of the date SBA receives a protest and whether SBA will process the protest or dismiss it in accordance with § 126.804.\n\n(2) If SBA determines the protest is timely and sufficiently specific, SBA will notify the protested concern of the protest and the identity of the protestor. The protested concern must submit information responsive to the protest within 5 business days of the date of receipt of the protest.\n\n(c) Burden of proof. In the event of a protest, the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility is on the protested concern. If a concern does not provide requested information within the allotted time provided by SBA, or if it submits incomplete information, SBA may draw an adverse inference and presume that the information that the concern failed to provide would demonstrate ineligibility and sustain the protest on that basis.\n\n(d) Time period for determination. (1) SBA will determine the HUBZone status of the protested concern within 15 business days after receipt of a complete protest referral.\n\n(2) If SBA does not issue its determination within 15 business days (or request an extension that is granted), the contracting officer may award the contract if he or she determines in writing that there is an immediate need to award the contract and that waiting until SBA makes its determination will be disadvantageous to the Government. Notwithstanding such a determination, the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section apply to the procurement in question.\n\n(e) Notice of determination. SBA will notify the contracting officer, the protestor, and the protested concern of its determination.\n\n(f) Effect of determination. The determination is effective immediately and is final, unless overturned on appeal by SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) pursuant to part 134 of this chapter.\n\n(1) Protest sustained. If the D/HUB finds the protested concern ineligible and sustains the protest, SBA will decertify the concern and remove its designation as a certified HUBZone small business concern in DSBS (or successor system). A contracting officer shall not award a contract to a protested concern that the D/HUB has determined is not an eligible HUBZone small business concern for the procurement in question.\n\n(i) No appeal filed. If a contracting officer receives a determination sustaining a protest after contract award, and no appeal has been filed, the contracting officer shall terminate the award.\n\n(ii) Appeal filed. (A) If a timely appeal is filed after contract award, the contracting officer must consider whether performance can be suspended until an appellate decision is rendered.\n\n(B) If OHA affirms the initial determination finding the protested concern ineligible, the contracting officer shall either terminate the contract or not exercise the next option.\n\n(iii) Update FPDS-NG. Where the contract was awarded to a concern that is found not to qualify as a HUBZone small business concern, the contracting officer must update the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) and other procurement reporting databases to reflect the final agency HUBZone decision (i.e., the D/HUB's decision if the protest determination is not appealed, or OHA's decision if the protest determination is appealed).\n\n(2) Protest dismissed or denied. If the D/HUB denies or dismisses the protest, the contracting officer may award the contract to the protested concern.\n\n(i) No appeal filed. If a contracting officer receives a determination dismissing or denying a protest and no appeal has been filed, the contracting officer may:\n\n(A) Award the contract to the protested concern if it has not yet been awarded; or\n\n(B) Authorize contract performance to proceed if the contract has been awarded.\n\n(ii) Appeal filed. If OHA overturns the initial determination or dismissal, the contracting officer may apply the appeal decision to the procurement in question.\n\n(3) A concern found to be ineligible may apply for HUBZone certification immediately after its decline if it believes that it has overcome all reasons for ineligibility through changed circumstances and is currently eligible.\n\n[63 FR 31908, June 11, 1998, as amended at 69 FR 29427, May 24, 2004; 74 FR 45754, Sept. 4, 2009; 76 FR 5685, Feb. 2, 2011; 76 FR 43574, July 21, 2011; 84 FR 65250, Nov. 26, 2019; 88 FR 21088, Apr. 10, 2023; 89 FR 102505, Dec. 17, 2024]",

In every contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, cooperative research and development agreement, or grant which is set aside, reserved, or otherwise classified as intended for award to HUBZone small business concerns, there shall be a presumption of loss to the United States based on the total amount expended on the contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, cooperative research and development agreement, or grant whenever it is established that a business concern other than a HUBZone small business concern willfully sought and received the award by misrepresentation.\n\n(b) Deemed Certifications. The following actions shall be deemed affirmative, willful and intentional certifications of HUBZone status:\n\n(1) Submission of a bid, proposal, application or offer for a Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, or cooperative research and development agreement reserved, set aside, or otherwise classified as intended for award to HUBZone small business concerns.\n\n(2) Submission of a bid, proposal, application or offer for a Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement or cooperative research and development agreement which in any way encourages a Federal agency to classify the bid or proposal, if awarded, as an award to a HUBZone small business concern.\n\n(3) Registration on any Federal electronic database for the purpose of being considered for award of a Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, or cooperative research and development agreement, as a HUBZone small business concern.\n\n(c) Signature Requirement. Each offer, proposal, bid, or application for a Federal contract, subcontract, or grant shall contain a certification concerning the HUBZone status of a business concern seeking the Federal contract, subcontract or grant. An authorized official must sign the certification on the same page containing the HUBZone status claimed by the concern.\n\n(d) Limitation of Liability. Paragraphs (a)-(c) of this section may be determined not to apply in the case of unintentional errors, technical malfunctions, and other similar situations that demonstrate that a misrepresentation of HUBZone status was not affirmative, intentional, willful or actionable under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729, et seq. A prime contractor acting in good faith should not be held liable for misrepresentations made by its subcontractors regarding the subcontractors' HUBZone status. Relevant factors to consider in making this determination may include the firm's internal management procedures governing HUBZone status representations or certifications, the clarity or ambiguity of the representation or certification requirement, and the efforts made to correct an incorrect or invalid representation or certification in a timely manner. An individual or firm may not be held liable where government personnel have erroneously identified a concern as a HUBZone small business concern without any representation or certification having been made by the concern and where such identification is made without the knowledge of the individual or firm.\n\n(e) Penalties for Misrepresentation. (1) Suspension or debarment. The SBA suspension and debarment official or the procuring agency's suspension and debarment official may suspend or debar a person or concern for misrepresenting a firm's status as a HUBZone small business concern pursuant to the procedures set forth in 48 CFR subpart 9.4.\n\n(2) Civil Penalties. Persons or concerns are subject to severe penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3733, the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 3801-3812, and any other applicable laws or regulations, including 13 CFR part 142.\n\n(3) Criminal Penalties. Persons or concerns are subject to severe criminal penalties for knowingly misrepresenting the HUBZone status of a concern in connection with procurement programs pursuant to section 16(d) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d), as amended, 18 U.S.C. 1001, 18 U.S.C. 287, and any other applicable laws. Persons or concerns are subject to criminal penalties for knowingly making false statements or misrepresentations to SBA for the purpose of influencing any actions of SBA pursuant to section 16(a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(a), as amended, including failure to correct “continuing representations” that are no longer true.\n\n(4) If SBA discovers that false or misleading information has been knowingly submitted by a small business concern in order to obtain or maintain HUBZone certification, SBA will propose the firm for decertification. In addition, SBA will refer the matter to the SBA Office of Inspector General for review and may recommend that Government-wide debarment or suspension proceedings be initiated.\n\n[78 FR 38820, June 28, 2013, as amended at 81 FR 31492, May 19, 2016; 89 FR 102505, Dec. 17, 2024]",

It includes—\n\n(1) Data collected from prospective Federal Awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;\n\n(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12 (48 CFR subpart 4.12); and\n\n(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal Contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.\n\nUnderrepresentation is determined by a study using a reliable and relevant methodology.\n\nWomen-Owned Small Business (WOSB) means a concern that qualifies as small pursuant to part 121 of this chapter under the size standard corresponding to any NAICS code listed in its SAM profile, and that is at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more women who are citizens in accordance with §§ 127.200, 127.201 and 127.202. This definition applies to any certification as to a concern's status as a WOSB, not solely to those certifications relating to a WOSB contract.\n\nWOSB requirement means a Federal requirement for services or supplies for which a contracting officer has restricted competition or awarded a sole source contract or order to eligible WOSBs, including Multiple Award Contracts, partial set-asides, reserves, sole source awards, and orders set aside for WOSBs issued against a Multiple Award Contract.\n\n[75 FR 62282, Oct. 7, 2010, as amended at 78 FR 61146, Oct. 2, 2013; 80 FR 55022, Sept. 14, 2015; 88 FR 26214, Apr. 27, 2023; 89 FR 96093, Dec. 4, 2024]",

To qualify as an EDWOSB, a concern must be:\n\n(1) A small business concern as defined in part 121 of this chapter under the size standard corresponding to any NAICS code listed in its SAM profile; and\n\n(2) Not less than 51 percent unconditionally and directly owned and controlled by one or more economically disadvantaged women who are citizens of and reside in the United States.\n\n(b) Qualification as a WOSB. To qualify as a WOSB, a concern must be:\n\n(1) A small business as defined in part 121 of this chapter for the size standard corresponding to any NAICS code listed in its SAM profile; and\n\n(2) Not less than 51 percent unconditionally and directly owned and controlled by one or more women who are citizens of and reside in the United States.\n\n(c) WOSB and EDWOSB certifications. (1) A concern must be certified as a WOSB or EDWOSB pursuant to § 127.300 in order to be awarded a WOSB or EDWOSB set-aside or sole-source contract.\n\n(2) Other women-owned small business concerns that do not seek WOSB or EDWOSB set-aside or sole-source contracts may continue to self-certify their status, receive contract awards outside the Program, and count toward an agency's goal for awards to WOSBs.\n\n(d) Size. In determining whether a concern qualifies as small for WOSB/EDWOSB certification and recertification under the size standard corresponding to a specific NAICS code, SBA will accept the concern's size representation in the System for Award Management (SAM), or successor system, unless there is evidence indicating that the concern is other than small. SBA will request a formal size determination pursuant to § 121.1001(b)(7) of this chapter where any information it possesses calls into question the concern's SAM size representation.\n\n(e) Federal financial obligations. A business concern is ineligible to be certified as a WOSB or EDWOSB or to participate in the WOSB program if either the concern or any of its principals has failed to pay significant financial obligations owed to the Federal Government, including unresolved tax liens and defaults on Federal loans or other Federally assisted financing. However, a small business concern may be eligible if the concern or the affected principals can demonstrate that they are current on an approved repayment plan, or the financial obligations owed have been settled and discharged/forgiven by the Federal Government.\n\n(f) Suspension and debarment. In order to be eligible for WOSB and EDWOSB certification and to remain certified, the concern and any of its owners must not have an active exclusion in the System for Award Management at the time of application or recertification.\n\n[75 FR 62282, Oct. 7, 2010, as amended at 85 FR 27660, May 11, 2020; 88 FR 26214, Apr. 27, 2023; 89 FR 102505, Dec. 17, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. To qualify as an EDWOSB one or more economically disadvantaged women must unconditionally and directly own at least 51 percent of the concern. To qualify as a WOSB, one or more women must unconditionally and directly own at least 51 percent of the concern. Ownership will be determined without regard to community property laws.\n\n(b) Unconditional ownership. To be considered unconditional, ownership must not be subject to any conditions, executory agreements, voting trusts, restrictions on or assignments of voting rights, or other arrangements causing or potentially causing ownership benefits to go to another (other than after death or incapacity).\n\n(1) The pledge or encumbrance of stock or other ownership interest as collateral, including seller-financed transactions, does not affect the unconditional nature of ownership if the terms follow normal commercial practices and the owner retains control absent violations of the terms.\n\n(2) In determining unconditional ownership, SBA will disregard any unexercised stock options or similar agreements held by qualifying women. However, any unexercised stock options or similar agreements (including rights to convert non-voting stock or debentures into voting stock) held by men or other entities will be treated as exercised, except for any ownership interests which are held by investment companies licensed under 15 U.S.C. 681 et. seq.\n\n(3) A right of first refusal granting a man or other entity the contractual right to purchase the ownership interests of the qualifying woman, does not affect the unconditional nature of ownership, if the terms follow normal commercial practices. If those rights are exercised by a man or other entity after certification, the WOSB/EDWOSB must notify SBA. If the exercise of those rights results in qualifying women owning less than 51% of the concern, SBA will initiate decertification pursuant to § 127.405.\n\n(c) Requirement for direct ownership. To be considered direct, the qualifying women must own 51 percent of the concern directly. The 51 percent ownership may not be through another business entity or a trust (including employee stock ownership plan) that is, in turn, owned and controlled by one or more women or economically disadvantaged women. However, ownership by a trust, such as a living trust, may be treated as the functional equivalent of ownership by a woman or economically disadvantaged woman where the trust is revocable, and the woman is the grantor, the trustee, and the sole current beneficiary of the trust.\n\n(d) Ownership of a partnership. In the case of a concern that is a partnership, at least 51 percent of each class of partnership interest must be unconditionally owned by one or more women or in the case of an EDWOSB, economically disadvantaged women. The ownership must be reflected in the concern's partnership agreement. For purposes of this requirement, general and limited partnership interests are considered different classes of partnership interest.\n\n(e) Ownership of a limited liability company. In the case of a concern that is a limited liability company, at least 51 percent of each class of member interest must be unconditionally owned by one or more women or in the case of an EDWOSB, economically disadvantaged women.\n\n(f) Ownership of a corporation. In the case of a concern that is a corporation, at least 51 percent of each class of voting stock outstanding and 51 percent of the aggregate of all stock outstanding must be unconditionally owned by one or more women, or in the case of an EDWOSB, economically disadvantaged women. In determining unconditional ownership of the concern, any unexercised stock options or similar agreements held by a woman will be disregarded. However, any unexercised stock option or other agreement, including the right to convert non-voting stock or debentures into voting stock, held by any other individual or entity will be treated as having been exercised.\n\n(g) Dividends and distributions. One or more qualifying women must be entitled to receive:\n\n(1) At least 51 percent of any distribution of profits paid to the owners of a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company concern, and a qualifying woman's ability to share in the profits of the concern must be commensurate with the extent of her ownership interest in that concern;\n\n(2) 100 percent of the value of each share of stock owned by them in the event that the stock is sold; and\n\n(3) At least 51 percent of the retained earnings of the concern and 100 percent of the unencumbered value of each share of stock or member interest owned in the event of dissolution of the corporation, partnership, or limited liability company.\n\n[75 FR 62282, Oct. 7, 2010, as amended at 88 FR 26214, Apr. 27, 2023; 89 FR 102506, Dec. 17, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. To qualify as a WOSB, the management and daily business operations of the concern must be controlled by one or more women. To qualify as an EDWOSB, the management and daily business operations of the concern must be controlled by one or more women who are economically disadvantaged. Control by one or more women or economically disadvantaged women means that both the long-term decision making and the day-to-day management and administration of the business operations must be conducted by one or more women or economically disadvantaged women.\n\n(b) Managerial position and experience. A woman, or in the case of an EDWOSB an economically disadvantaged woman, must hold the highest officer position in the concern and must have managerial experience of the extent and complexity needed to run the concern. The woman or economically disadvantaged woman manager need not have the technical expertise or possess the required license to be found to control the concern if she can demonstrate that she has ultimate managerial and supervisory control over those who possess the required licenses or technical expertise. However, if a man possesses the required license and has an equity interest in the concern, he may be found to control the concern.\n\n(c) Limitation on outside employment. (1) A woman or economically disadvantaged woman generally must devote full time to the business concern during its normal hours of operations. The woman or economically disadvantaged woman who holds the highest officer position of the business concern may not engage in outside employment that prevents her from devoting the time and attention to the business concern necessary to control its management and daily operations.\n\n(2) Where a woman or economically disadvantaged woman claiming to control a business concern devotes fewer hours to the business than its normal hours of operation, SBA will assume that she does not control the business concern, unless the concern demonstrates that she has ultimate managerial and supervisory control over both the long-term decision making and day-to-day management of the business.\n\n(3) Any qualifying woman or economically disadvantage woman who seeks to engage in outside employment after certification must notify SBA of the nature and anticipated duration of the outside employment and demonstrate to SBA that the outside employment will not prevent her from controlling the business concern.\n\n(d) Ownership of a partnership. In the case of a concern which is a partnership, one or more qualifying women, or in the case of an EDWOSB, economically disadvantaged women, must serve as general partners, with control over all partnership decisions. At least 51 percent of every class of partnership interest must be unconditionally owned by one or more qualifying women or economically disadvantaged women. The ownership must be reflected in the concern's partnership agreement.\n\n(e) Control over a limited liability company. In the case of a limited liability company, one or more women, or in the case of an EDWOSB, economically disadvantaged women, must serve as management members, with control over all decisions of the limited liability company.\n\n(f) Control over a corporation. One or more women, or in the case of an EDWOSB, economically disadvantaged women, must control the Board of Directors of the concern. Women or economically disadvantaged women are considered to control the Board of Directors when either:\n\n(1) One or more women or economically disadvantaged women own at least 51 percent of all voting stock of the concern, are on the Board of Directors and have the percentage of voting stock necessary to overcome any super majority voting requirements; or\n\n(2) Women or economically disadvantaged women comprise the majority of voting directors through actual numbers or, where permitted by state law, through weighted voting.\n\n(g) Involvement in the concern by other individuals or entities. Men or other entities may be involved in the management of the concern and may be stockholders, partners or limited liability members of the concern. However, no males or other entities may:\n\n(1) Exercise actual control or have the power to control the concern;\n\n(2) Have business relationships that cause such dependence that the qualifying woman cannot exercise independent business judgment without great economic risk;\n\n(3) Control the concern through loan arrangements (which does not include providing a loan guaranty on commercially reasonable terms);\n\n(4) Provide critical financial or bonding support or a critical license to the concern, which directly or indirectly allows the male or other entity to significantly influence business decisions of the qualifying woman.\n\n(5) Be a former employer, or a principal of a former employer, of any qualifying woman, unless the concern demonstrates that the relationship between the former employer or principal and the qualifying woman does not give the former employer actual control or the potential to control the concern and such relationship is in the best interests of the concern; or\n\n(6) Receive compensation from the concern in any form as a director, officer, or employee, that exceeds the compensation to be received by the qualifying woman who holds the highest officer position (usually Chief Executive Officer or President), unless the concern demonstrates that the compensation to be received by non-qualifying woman is commercially reasonable or that the qualifying woman has elected to take lower compensation to benefit the concern. A certified WOSB or EDWOSB must notify SBA within 30 calendar days if the compensation paid to the highest-ranking officer falls below that paid to a man. In such a case, SBA must determine that that the compensation to be received by the man is commercially reasonable or that the highest-ranking officer has elected to take lower compensation to benefit the WOSB or EDWOSB before SBA may determine that the concern is eligible for a WOSB/EDWOSB award.\n\n(h) Exception for extraordinary circumstances. SBA will not find that a lack of control exists where a woman or an economically disadvantaged woman does not have the unilateral power and authority to make decisions regarding the following extraordinary circumstances:\n\n(1) Adding a new equity stakeholder or increasing the investment amount of an equity stakeholder;\n\n(2) Dissolution of the company;\n\n(3) Sale of the company or all assets of the company;\n\n(4) The merger of the company;\n\n(5) The company declaring bankruptcy;\n\n(6) Amendment of the company's corporate governance documents to remove the shareholder's authority to block any of the actions in paragraphs (h)(1) through (5) of this section; and\n\n(7) Any other extraordinary action that is crafted solely to protect the investment of the minority shareholders, and not to impede the majority's ability to control the concern's operations or to conduct the concern's business as it chooses.\n\n[75 FR 62282, Oct. 7, 2010, as amended at 88 FR 26214, Apr. 27, 2023; 89 FR 96093, Dec. 4, 2024; 89 FR 102506, Dec. 17, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. To qualify as an EDWOSB, the concern must be at least 51 percent owned by one or more women who are economically disadvantaged. A woman is economically disadvantaged if she can demonstrate that her ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same or similar line of business. SBA does not take into consideration community property laws when determining economic disadvantage when the woman has no direct, individual or separate ownership interest in the property.\n\n(b) Limitation on personal net worth. (1) In order to be considered economically disadvantaged, the woman's personal net worth must be less than $850,000, excluding her ownership interest in the concern and her equity interest in her primary personal residence.\n\n(2) Income received from an EDWOSB that is an S corporation, LLC or partnership will be excluded from net worth where the EDWOSB provides documentary evidence demonstrating that the income was reinvested in the business concern or the distribution was solely for the purposes of paying taxes arising in the normal course of operations of the business concern. Losses from the S corporation, LLC or partnership, however, are losses to the EDWOSB only, not losses to the individual, and cannot be used to reduce an individual's net worth.\n\n(3) Funds invested in an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or other official retirement account will not be considered in determining an individual's net worth. In order to properly assess whether funds invested in a retirement account may be excluded from a woman's net worth, she must provide information about the terms and restrictions of the account to SBA and certify that the retirement account is legitimate.\n\n(c) Factors to be considered. (1) General. The personal financial condition of the woman claiming economic disadvantage, including her personal income for the past three years (including bonuses, and the value of company stock given in lieu of cash), her personal net worth and the fair market value of all of her assets, whether encumbered or not, will be considered in determining whether she is economically disadvantaged.\n\n(2) Spouse's financial situation. SBA may consider a spouse's financial situation in determining a woman's access to credit and capital. When married, an individual claiming economic disadvantage must submit separate financial information for her spouse, unless the individual and the spouse are legally separated. SBA will consider a spouse's financial situation in determining an individual's access to credit and capital where the spouse has a role in the business (e.g., an officer, employee or director) or has lent money to, provided credit or financial support to, or guaranteed a loan of the business. SBA may also consider the spouse's financial condition if the spouse's business is in the same or similar line of business as the EDWOSB or WOSB and the spouse's business and WOSB share similar names, Web sites, equipment or employees. In addition, all transfers to a spouse within two years of a certification will be attributed to a woman claiming economic disadvantage as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(3) Income.\n\n(i) When considering a woman's personal income, if the adjusted gross yearly income averaged over the three years preceding the certification exceeds $400,000, SBA will presume that she is not economically disadvantaged. The presumption may be rebutted by a showing that this income level was unusual and not likely to occur in the future, that losses commensurate with and directly related to the earnings were suffered, or by evidence that the income is not indicative of lack of economic disadvantage.\n\n(ii) Income received by an EDWOSB that is an S corporation, LLC, or partnership will be excluded from an individual's income where the EDWOSB provides documentary evidence demonstrating that the income was reinvested in the EDWOSB or the distribution was solely for the purposes of paying taxes arising in the normal course of operations of the business concern. Losses from the S corporation, LLC or partnership, however, are losses to the EDWOSB only, not losses to the individual, and cannot be used to reduce a woman's personal income.\n\n(4) Fair market value of all assets. A woman will generally not be considered economically disadvantaged if the fair market value of all her assets (including her primary residence and the value of the business concern) exceeds $6.5 million. The only assets excluded from this determination are funds excluded under paragraph (b)(3) of this section as being invested in a qualified IRA account or other official retirement account.\n\n(d) Transfers within two years. Assets that a woman claiming economic disadvantage transferred within two years of the date of the concern's certification will be attributed to the woman claiming economic disadvantage if the assets were transferred to an immediate family member, or to a trust that has as a beneficiary an immediate family member. The transferred assets within the two-year period will not be attributed to the woman if the transfer was:\n\n(1) To or on behalf of an immediate family member for that individual's education, medical expenses, or some other form of essential support; or\n\n(2) To an immediate family member in recognition of a special occasion, such as a birthday, graduation, anniversary, or retirement.\n\n[75 FR 62282, Oct. 7, 2010, as amended at 85 FR 27660, May 11, 2020; 87 FR 69154, Nov. 17, 2022]",

Concern A is certified by SBA to be eligible for the WOSB Program on March 31, 2023. Concern A is considered a certified WOSB that is eligible to receive WOSB contracts (as long as it is small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract) through March 30, 2026.

On May 15, 2025, Concern A receives a positive determination from SBA confirming that it is an eligible WOSB. Concern A's new certification date is May 15, 2025. Concern A is now considered a certified WOSB that is eligible to receive WOSB contracts (as long as it is small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract) through May 14, 2028.\n\n(b) The concern must either recertify with SBA or notify SBA that it has completed a program examination from a third party certifier within 90 calendar days of the end of its eligibility period.

In addition, SBA will refer the matter to the SBA Office of Inspector General for review and may recommend that Government-wide debarment or suspension proceedings be initiated.\n\n(1) A firm that is decertified from the WOSB program due to the submission of false or misleading information may be removed from SBA's other small business contracting programs, including the 8(a) Business Development Program, the HUBZone Program, the Veteran Small Business Certification (VetCert) Program, and SBA's Mentor-Protégé Program.\n\n(2) A firm that is decertified or terminated from the 8(a) BD Program, the HUBZone Program, or the VetCert Program due to the submission of false or misleading information may be decertified from the WOSB Program.\n\n(3) SBA may require a firm that is decertified or terminated from the WOSB Program, 8(a) BD Program, the HUBZone Program, or the VetCert Program due to the submission of false or misleading information to enter into an administrative agreement with SBA as a condition of admission or re-admission to the WOSB program.\n\n(e) Effect of decertification. Once SBA has decertified a concern, the concern cannot self-certify as a WOSB or EDWOSB, as applicable, for any WOSB or EDWOSB contract. If a concern does so, it may be in violation of criminal laws, including section 16(d) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d). If the concern has already certified itself as a WOSB or EDWOSB on a pending procurement, the concern must immediately inform the contracting officer for the procuring agency of its decertification.\n\n(1) Not later than two days after the date on which SBA decertifies a business concern, such concern must update its WOSB/EDWOSB status in the System for Award Management (or any successor system).\n\n(2) If a business concern fails to update its WOSB/EDWOSB status in the System for Award Management (or any successor system) in response to decertification, SBA will make such update within two days of the business's failure to do so.\n\n(f) Reapplication. A concern decertified pursuant to this section may reapply to the program pursuant to § 127.305.\n\n[85 FR 27664, May 11, 2020, as amended at 88 FR 26215, Apr. 27, 2023; 89 FR 102507, Dec. 17, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) Competition restricted to EDWOSBs. For requirements in industries designated by SBA as underrepresented pursuant to § 127.501, a contracting officer may restrict competition to EDWOSBs if the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation based on market research that:\n\n(1) Two or more EDWOSBs will submit offers for the contract; and\n\n(2) Contract award may be made at a fair and reasonable price.\n\n(b) Competition restricted to WOSBs. For requirements in industries designated by SBA as substantially underrepresented pursuant to § 127.501, a contracting officer may restrict competition to WOSBs if the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation based on market research that:\n\n(1) Two or more WOSBs will submit offers (this includes EDWOSBs, which are also WOSBs); and\n\n(2) Contract award may be made at a fair and reasonable price.\n\n(c) Sole source awards to EDWOSBs. For requirements in industries designated by SBA as underrepresented pursuant to § 127.501, a contracting officer may issue a sole source award to an EDWOSB when the contacting officer determines that:\n\n(1) The EDWOSB is a responsible contractor with respect to performance of the requirement and the contracting officer does not have a reasonable expectation that 2 or more EDWOSBs will submit offers;\n\n(2) The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $7,000,000 in the case of a contract assigned a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for manufacturing, or $4,500,000 in the case of any other contract opportunity; and\n\n(3) In the estimation of the contracting officer, the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price.\n\n(d) Sole source awards to WOSBs. For requirements in industries designated by SBA as substantially underrepresented pursuant to § 127.501, a contracting officer may issue a sole source award to a WOSB when the contacting officer determines that:\n\n(1) The WOSB is a responsible contractor with respect to performance of the requirement and the contracting officer does not have a reasonable expectation that 2 or more WOSBs will submit offers;\n\n(2) The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $7,000,000 in the case of a contract assigned a NAICS code for manufacturing, or $4,500,000 in the case of any other contract opportunity; and\n\n(3) In the estimation of the contracting officer, the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price.\n\n(e) Competitions requiring or favoring additional socioeconomic certifications. A procuring activity cannot restrict a WOSB or EDWOSB competition (for either a contract or order) to require SBA socioeconomic certifications other than WOSB/EDWOSB certification (i.e., a competition cannot be limited only to business concerns that are both WOSB/EDWOSB and 8(a), WOSB/EDWOSB and HUBZone, or WOSB/EDWOSB and SDVO) or give evaluation preferences to firms having one or more other certifications.\n\n(f) 8(a) BD requirements. A contracting officer may not restrict competition to eligible EDWOSBs or WOSBs if an 8(a) BD Participant is currently performing the requirement under the 8(a) BD Program or SBA has accepted the requirement for performance under the authority of the 8(a) BD program, unless SBA consented to release the requirement from the 8(a) BD program.\n\n(g) Contracting Among Small Business Programs. (1) Acquisitions Valued At or Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. The contracting officer shall set aside any acquisition with an anticipated dollar value exceeding the Micro-purchase Threshold but not exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101) for small business concerns when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two small business concerns that are competitive in terms of quality and delivery and award will be made at fair market prices. This requirement does not preclude a contracting officer from making an award to a small business under the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVO SBC or WOSB Programs.\n\n(2) Acquisitions Valued Above the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. (i) The contracting officer shall set aside any acquisition with an anticipated dollar value exceeding the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101) for small business concerns when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two small business concerns that are competitive in terms of quality and delivery and award will be made at fair market prices. However, after conducting market research, the contracting officer shall first consider a set-aside or sole source award (if the sole source award is permitted by statute or regulation) under the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVO SBC or WOSB programs before setting aside the requirement as a small business set-aside. There is no order of precedence among the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVO SBC or WOSB programs. The contracting officer must document the contract file with the rationale used to support the specific set-aside, including the type and extent of market research conducted. In addition, the contracting officer must document the contract file showing that the apparent successful offeror's certifications in SAM (or any successor system) and associated representations were reviewed.\n\n(ii) SBA believes that Progress in fulfilling the various small business goals, as well as other factors such as the results of market research, programmatic needs specific to the procuring agency, anticipated award price, and the acquisition history, will be considered in making a decision as to which program to use for the acquisition.\n\n(h) Contract file. When restricting competition to WOSBs or EDWOSBs in accordance with § 127.503, the contracting officer must document the contract file accordingly, including the type and extent of market research and the fact that the NAICS code assigned to the contract is for an industry that SBA has designated as an underrepresented or, with respect to WOSBs, substantially underrepresented, industry. In addition, the contracting officer must document the contract file showing that the apparent successful offeror's documents and certifications in SAM (or any successor system) and associated representations were reviewed.\n\n[75 FR 62282, Oct. 7, 2010, as amended at 77 FR 1861, Jan. 12, 2012; 78 FR 26506, May 7, 2013; 78 FR 61147, Oct. 2, 2013; 79 FR 31849, June 3, 2014; 80 FR 55022, Sept. 14, 2015; 83 FR 12852, Mar. 26, 2018; 84 FR 65665, Nov. 29, 2019; 85 FR 27664, May 11, 2020; 85 FR 66197, Oct. 16, 2020; 86 FR 61673, Nov. 8, 2021; 88 FR 26215, Apr. 27, 2023]",

    "content": "(a) General. In order for a concern to submit an offer on a specific EDWOSB or WOSB set-aside requirement, the concern must, at the time of its initial offer that includes price:\n\n(1) Qualify as a small business concern under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract;\n\n(2) Meet the eligibility requirements of an EDWOSB or WOSB in § 127.200; and\n\n(3) Either be a certified EDWOSB or WOSB pursuant to § 127.300, or represent that the concern has submitted a complete application for WOSB or EDWOSB certification to SBA or a third-party certifier and has not received a negative determination regarding that application from SBA or the third party certifier.\n\n(i) If a concern becomes the apparent successful offeror while its application for WOSB or EDWOSB certification is pending, either at SBA or a third-party certifier, the contracting officer for the particular contract must immediately inform SBA's D/GC. SBA will then prioritize the concern's WOSB or EDWOSB application and make a determination regarding the firm's status as a WOSB or EDWOSB within 15 calendar days from the date that SBA received the contracting officer's notification. Where the application is pending with a third-party certifier, SBA will immediately contact the third-party certifier to require the third-party certifier to complete its determination within 15 calendar days.\n\n(ii) If the contracting officer does not receive an SBA or third-party certifier determination within 15 calendar days after the SBA's receipt of the notification, the contracting officer may presume that the apparently successful offeror is not an eligible WOSB or EDWOSB and may make award accordingly, unless the contracting officer grants an extension to the 15-day response period.\n\n(b) Sole source EDWOSB or WOSB requirements. In order for a concern to seek a specific sole source EDWOSB or WOSB requirement, the concern must be a certified EDWOSB or WOSB pursuant to § 127.300 and qualify as small under the size standard corresponding to the requirement being sought.\n\n(c) Joint ventures. A business concern seeking an EDWOSB or WOSB contract as a joint venture may submit an offer if the joint venture meets the requirements as set forth in § 127.506.\n\n(d) Multiple Award Contracts. With respect to Multiple Award Contracts, orders issued against a Multiple Award Contract, and Blanket Purchase Agreements issued against a Multiple Award Contract:\n\n(1) SBA determines EDWOSB or WOSB eligibility for the underlying Multiple Award Contract as of the date a concern certifies its status as an EDWOSB or WOSB as part of its initial offer (or other formal response to a solicitation), which includes price, unless the concern was required to recertify its status as a WOSB or EDWOSB under § 125.12 of this chapter.\n\n(i) Unrestricted Multiple Award Contracts or Set-Aside Multiple Award Contracts for Other than EDWOSB or WOSB. For an unrestricted Multiple Award Contract or other Multiple Award Contract not set aside specifically for EDWOSB or WOSB, if a business concern is an EDWOSB or WOSB at the time of offer and contract-level recertification for the Multiple Award Contract, it is an EDWOSB or WOSB for goaling purposes for each order issued against the contract, unless a contracting officer requests recertification as an EDWOSB or WOSB for a specific order or Blanket Purchase Agreement. Except for orders and Blanket Purchase Agreements issued under any Federal Supply Schedule contract, if an order or a Blanket Purchase Agreement under an unrestricted Multiple Award Contract is set aside exclusively for EDWOSB or WOSB, a concern must recertify it qualifies as an EDWOSB or WOSB at the time it submits its initial offer, which includes price, for the particular order or Agreement. However, where the underlying Multiple Award Contract has been awarded to a pool of WOSB or EDWOSB concerns for which WOSB or EDWOSB status is required, if an order or a Blanket Purchase Agreement under that Multiple Award Contract is set aside exclusively for concerns in the WOSB or EDWOSB pool, concerns need not recertify their status as WOSBs or EDWOSBs (unless a contracting officer requests size certifications with respect to a specific order or Blanket Purchase Agreement).\n\n(ii) EDWOSB or WOSB Set-Aside Multiple Award Contracts. For a Multiple Award Contract that is set aside specifically for EDWOSB or WOSB, if a business concern is an EDWOSB or WOSB at the time of offer and contract-level recertification for the Multiple Award Contract, it is an EDWOSB or WOSB for each order issued against the contract, unless a contracting officer requests recertification as an EDWOSB or WOSB for a specific order or Blanket Purchase Agreement.\n\n(2) SBA will determine EDWOSB or WOSB status at the time a business concern submits its initial offer (or other formal response to a solicitation) which includes price for an order or an Agreement issued against a Multiple Award Contract if the contracting officer requests a new EDWOSB or WOSB certification for the order or Agreement.\n\n(e) Limitations on subcontracting. A business concern seeking an EDWOSB or WOSB requirement must also meet the applicable limitations on subcontracting requirements as set forth in § 125.6 of this chapter for the performance of EDWOSB or WOSB contracts (both sole source and those totally set aside for EDWOSB or WOSB), the performance of the set-aside portion of a partial set-aside contract, or the performance of orders set-aside for EDWOSB or WOSB.\n\n(f) Non-manufacturers. An EDWOSB or WOSB that is a non-manufacturer, as defined in § 121.406(b) of this chapter, may submit an offer on an EDWOSB or WOSB contract for supplies, if it meets the requirements under the non-manufacturer rule set forth in § 121.406(b) of this chapter.\n\n(g) Ostensible subcontractor. Where a subcontractor that is not similarly situated performs primary and vital requirements of a set-aside service contract, or where a prime contractor is unduly reliant on a small business that is not similarly situated to perform the set-aside service contract, the prime contractor is not eligible for award of a WOSB or EDWOSB contract.\n\n(1) When the subcontractor is small for the size standard assigned to the procurement, this issue may be grounds for a WOSB or EDWOSB status protest, as described in subpart F of this part. When the subcontractor is other than small or alleged to be other than small for the size standard assigned to the procurement, this issue may be grounds for a size protest, as described at § 121.103(h)(3) of this chapter.\n\n(2) In the case of a contract or order for services, specialty trade construction or supplies, SBA will find that a prime WOSB or EDWOSB contractor is performing the primary and vital requirements of the contract or order, and is not unduly reliant on one or more subcontractors that are not certified WOSBs or EDWOSBs, where the prime contractor can demonstrate that it, together with any subcontractors that are certified WOSBs or EDWOSBs, will meet the limitations on subcontracting provisions set forth in § 125.6 of this chapter.\n\n(3) In a general construction contract, the primary and vital requirements of the contract are the management, supervision and oversight of the project, including coordinating the work of various subcontractors, not the actual construction work performed.\n\n(h) Recertification. A prime contractor that receives an award as a certified WOSB or EDWOSB must comply with the recertification requirements set forth in § 125.12 of this chapter regarding its status as a certified WOSB or EDWOSB.\n\n[85 FR 66197, Oct. 16, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 10732, Feb. 23, 2021; 88 FR 26215, Apr. 27, 2023; 89 FR 96094, Dec. 4, 2024; 89 FR 102507, Dec. 17, 2024]",

    "content": "A joint venture, including those between a protégé and a mentor under § 125.9 of this chapter (or, if also an 8(a) BD Participant, under § 124.520 of this chapter), may submit an offer on a WOSB Program contract if the joint venture meets all of the following requirements:\n\n(a)(1) A joint venture of at least one WOSB or EDWOSB and one or more other business concerns may submit an offer as a small business for a WOSB Program procurement or sale so long as each concern is small under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the procurement or sale.\n\n(2) A joint venture between a protégé firm and its SBA-approved mentor (see § 125.9 and § 124.520 of this chapter) will be deemed small provided the protégé qualifies as small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the WOSB Program procurement or sale.\n\n(3) A WOSB or EDWOSB cannot be a joint venture partner on more than one joint venture that submits an offer for a specific contract or order set-aside or reserved for WOSBs or EDWOSBs.\n\n(b) The EDWOSB or WOSB participant of the joint venture must be designated in SAM (or any successor system)as an EDWOSB or WOSB;\n\n(c) Contents of joint venture agreement. The parties to the joint venture must enter into a written joint venture agreement. The joint venture agreement must contain a provision:\n\n(1) Setting forth the purpose of the joint venture.\n\n(2) Designating a WOSB or EDWOSB as the managing venturer of the joint venture, and designating a named employee of the WOSB or EDWOSB managing venturer as the manager with ultimate responsibility for performance of the contract (the “Responsible Manager”).\n\n(i) The managing venturer is responsible for controlling the day-to-day management and administration of the contractual performance of the joint venture, but other partners to the joint venture may participate in all corporate governance activities and decisions of the joint venture as is commercially customary.\n\n(ii) The individual identified as the Responsible Manager of the joint venture need not be an employee of the WOSB or EDWOSB at the time the joint venture submits an offer, but, if he or she is not, there must be a signed letter of intent that the individual commits to be employed by the WOSB or EDWOSB if the joint venture is the successful offeror. The individual identified as the Responsible Manager cannot be employed by the mentor and become an employee of the WOSB or EDWOSB for purposes of performance under the joint venture.\n\n(iii) Although the joint venture managers responsible for orders issued under an IDIQ contract need not be employees of the protégé, those managers must report to and be supervised by the joint venture's Responsible Manager.\n\n(3) Stating that with respect to a separate legal entity joint venture, the WOSB must own at least 51% of the joint venture entity;\n\n(4) Stating that the WOSB or EDWOSB must receive profits from the joint venture commensurate with the work performed by the WOSB or EDWOSB, or a percentage agreed to by the parties to the joint venture whereby the WOSB or EDWOSB receives profits from the joint venture that exceed the percentage commensurate with the work performed by the WOSB or EDWOSB;\n\n(5) Providing for the establishment and administration of a special bank account in the name of the joint venture. This account must require the signature or consent of all parties to the joint venture for any payments made by the joint venture to its members for services performed. All payments due the joint venture for performance on a WOSB Program contract will be deposited in the special account; all expenses incurred under the contract will be paid from the account as well;\n\n(6) Itemizing all major equipment, facilities, and other resources to be furnished by each party to the joint venture, with a detailed schedule of cost or value of each, where practical. If a contract is indefinite in nature, such as an indefinite quantity contract or a multiple award contract where the level of effort or scope of work is not known, the joint venture must provide a general description of the anticipated major equipment, facilities, and other resources to be furnished by each party to the joint venture, without a detailed schedule of cost or value of each, or in the alternative, specify how the parties to the joint venture will furnish such resources to the joint venture once a definite scope of work is made publicly available;\n\n(7) Specifying the responsibilities of the parties with regard to negotiation of the contract, source of labor, and contract performance, including ways that the parties to the joint venture will ensure that the joint venture and the WOSB Program participant(s) in the joint venture will meet the performance of work requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, where practical. If a contract is indefinite in nature, such as an indefinite quantity contract or a multiple award contract where the level of effort or scope of work is not known, the joint venture must provide a general description of the anticipated responsibilities of the parties with regard to negotiation of the contract, source of labor, and contract performance, not including the ways that the parties to the joint venture will ensure that the joint venture and the WOSB Program participant(s) in the joint venture will meet the performance of work requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, or in the alternative, specify how the parties to the joint venture will define such responsibilities once a definite scope of work is made publicly available;\n\n(8) Obligating all parties to the joint venture to ensure performance of the WOSB contract and to complete performance despite the withdrawal of any member;\n\n(9) Designating that accounting and other administrative records relating to the joint venture be kept in the office of the WOSB managing venturer, unless approval to keep them elsewhere is granted by the District Director or his/her designee upon written request;\n\n(10) Requiring that the final original records be retained by the WOSB managing venturer upon completion of the WOSB Program contract performed by the joint venture;\n\n(11) Stating that quarterly financial statements showing cumulative contract receipts and expenditures (including salaries of the joint venture's principals) must be submitted to SBA not later than 45 days after each operating quarter of the joint venture; and\n\n(12) Stating that a project-end profit and loss statement, including a statement of final profit distribution, must be submitted to SBA no later than 90 days after completion of the contract.\n\n(d) Performance of work. (1) For any WOSB Program contract, the joint venture (including one between a protégé and a mentor authorized by § 125.9 or § 124.520 of this chapter) must perform the applicable percentage of work required by § 125.6 of this chapter.\n\n(2) The WOSB partner(s) to the joint venture must perform at least 40% of the work performed by the joint venture.\n\n(i) The work performed by the WOSB partner(s) to a joint venture must be more than administrative or ministerial functions so that they gain substantive experience.\n\n(ii) The amount of work done by the partners will be aggregated and the work done by the WOSB partner(s) must be at least 40% of the total done by all partners. In determining the amount of work done by the non-WOSB partner, all work done by the non-WOSB partner and any of its affiliates at any subcontracting tier will be counted.\n\n(e) Certification of compliance. Prior to the performance of any WOSB Program contract as a joint venture, the WOSB Program participant in the joint venture must submit a written certification to the contracting officer and SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, stating as follows:\n\n(i) The parties have entered into a joint venture agreement that fully complies with paragraph (c) of this section;\n\n(ii) The parties will perform the contract in compliance with the joint venture agreement and with the performance of work requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(f) Capabilities, past performance, and experience. When evaluating the capabilities, past performance, experience, business systems, and certifications of an entity submitting an offer for an EDWOSB or WOSB contract as a joint venture established pursuant to this section, a procuring activity must consider work done and qualifications held individually by each partner to the joint venture as well as any work done by the joint venture itself previously. A procuring activity may not require the EDWOSB or WOSB small business concern to individually meet the same evaluation or responsibility criteria as that required of other offerors generally. The partners to the joint venture in the aggregate must demonstrate the past performance, experience, business systems, and certifications necessary to perform the contract.\n\n(g) Contract execution. The procuring activity will execute a WOSB Program contract in the name of the joint venture entity or the WOSB, but in either case will identify the award as one to a WOSB Program joint venture or a WOSB Program mentor-protégé joint venture, as appropriate.\n\n(h) Submission of joint venture agreement. The WOSB Program participant must provide a copy of the joint venture agreement to the contracting officer.\n\n(i) Inspection of records. The joint venture partners must allow SBA's authorized representatives, including representatives authorized by the SBA Inspector General, during normal business hours, access to its files to inspect and copy all records and documents relating to the joint venture.\n\n(j) Performance of work reports. The WOSB Program participant in the joint venture must describe how it is meeting or has met the applicable performance of work requirements for each WOSB Program contract it performs as a joint venture.\n\n(1) The WOSB partner to the joint venture must annually submit a report to the relevant contracting officer and to the SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, explaining how the performance of work requirements are being met for each WOSB Program contract performed during the year.\n\n(2) At the completion of every WOSB Program contract awarded to a joint venture, the WOSB partner to the joint venture must submit a report to the relevant contracting officer and to the SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, explaining how and certifying that the performance of work requirements were met for the contract, and further certifying that the contract was performed in accordance with the provisions of the joint venture agreement that are required under paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(k) Basis for suspension or debarment. The Government may consider the following as a ground for suspension or debarment as a willful violation of a regulatory provision or requirement applicable to a public agreement or transaction:\n\n(1) Failure to enter a joint venture agreement that complies with paragraph (c) of this section;\n\n(2) Failure to perform a contract in accordance with the joint venture agreement or performance of work requirements in paragraph (d) of this section; or\n\n(3) Failure to submit the certification required by paragraph (e) or comply with paragraph (i) of this section.\n\n(l) Any person with information concerning a joint venture's compliance with the performance of work requirements may report that information to SBA and/or the SBA Office of Inspector General.\n\n[75 FR 62282, Oct. 7, 2010, as amended at 78 FR 61147, Oct. 2, 2013; 81 FR 34265, May 31, 2016; 81 FR 48593, July 25, 2016; 81 FR 94942, Dec. 27, 2016; 85 FR 66199, Oct. 16, 2020; 86 FR 2960, Jan. 14, 2021; 88 FR 26215, Apr. 27, 2023]",

SBA will also consider a protest challenging the status of a concern as an EDWOSB or WOSB if the contracting officer has protested because the WOSB or EDWOSB apparent successful offeror has failed to provide all of the required documents, as set forth in § 127.300. In addition, when sufficient credible evidence is presented, SBA will consider a protest challenging whether the prime contractor is unusually reliant on a small, non-similarly situated entity subcontractor, as defined in § 125.1 of this chapter, or a protest alleging that such subcontractor is performing the primary and vital requirements of a set-aside or sole-source WOSB or EDWOSB contract.\n\n(b) For a protest filed against an EDWOSB or WOSB joint venture, the protest must state all specific grounds for why—\n\n(1) The EDOWSB or WOSB partner to the joint venture did not meet the EDWOSB or WOSB eligibility requirements set forth in § 127.200; and/or\n\n(2) The protested EDWOSB or WOSB joint venture did not meet the requirements set forth in § 127.506.\n\n[75 FR 62282, Oct. 7, 2010, as amended at 84 FR 65251, Nov. 26, 2019; 84 FR 65665, Nov. 29, 2019]",

Protestors may deliver their written protests in person, by facsimile, by express delivery service, e-mail, or by U.S. mail (received by the applicable date) to the following:\n\n(1) To the contracting officer, if the protestor is an offeror for the specific contract; or\n\n(2) To the D/GC, if the protest is initiated by the contracting officer or SBA. IF SBA initiates a protest, the D/GC will notify the contracting officer of such protest.\n\n(c) Timeliness. (1) For negotiated acquisitions, a protest from an interested party must be received by the contracting officer prior to the close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the apparent successful offeror or notification of award. Except for an order or Blanket Purchase Agreement issued under any Federal Supply Schedule contact, for an order or a Blanket Purchase Agreement that is set-aside for EDWOSB or WOSB small business under a Multiple Award Contract that is not itself set aside for EDWOSB or WOSB small business or have a reserve for EDWOSB or WOSB small business (or any EDWOSB or WOSB order where the contracting officer has requested recertification of such status), an interested party must submit its protest challenging the EDWOSB or WOSB status of a concern for the order or Blanket Purchase Agreement by close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the apparent successful offeror.\n\n(2) For sealed bid acquisitions, a protest from an interested party must be received by close of business on the fifth business day after bid opening. Where the identified low bidder is determined to be ineligible for award, a protest of any other identified low bidder must be received prior to the close of business on the 5th business day after the contracting officer has notified interested parties of the identity of that low bidder.\n\n(3) Any protest received after the time limit is untimely, unless it is from SBA or the contracting officer. A contracting officer or SBA may file an EDWOSB or WOSB protest at any time after bid opening or notification of intended awardee, whichever applies.\n\n(4) Any protest received prior to bid opening or notification of intended awardee, whichever applies, is premature.\n\n(5) A timely filed protest applies to the procurement in question even if filed after award.\n\n(d) Referral to SBA. The contracting officer must forward to SBA any WOSB or EDWOSB status protest received, notwithstanding whether he or she believes it is premature, sufficiently specific, or timely. The contracting officer must send all WOSB and EDWOSB status protests, along with a referral letter and documents, directly to the Director for Government Contracting, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street SW, Washington, DC 20416, or by fax to (202) 205-6390, Attn: Women-Owned Small Business Status Protest.\n\n(1) The contracting officer's referral letter must include information pertaining to the solicitation that may be necessary for SBA to determine timeliness and standing, including: the solicitation number; the name, address, telephone number and facsimile number of the contracting officer; whether the protestor submitted an offer; whether the protested concern was the apparent successful offeror; when the protested concern submitted its offer; whether the procurement was conducted using sealed bid or negotiated procedures; the bid opening date, if applicable; when the protest was submitted to the contracting officer; when the protestor received notification about the apparent successful offeror, if applicable; and whether a contract has been awarded.\n\n(2) Where a protestor alleges that a WOSB/EDWOSB is unduly reliant on one or more subcontractors that are not WOSBs/EDWOSBs or a subcontractor that is not a WOSB/EDWOSB will perform primary and vital requirements of the contract, the D/GC or designee will refer the matter to the Government Contracting Area Office serving the geographic area in which the principal office of the SDVO SBC is located for a determination as to whether the ostensible subcontractor rule has been met.\n\n(3) The D/GC or designee will decide the merits of EDWOSB or WOSB status protests.\n\n[75 FR 62282, Oct. 7, 2010, as amended at 85 FR 27665, May 11, 2020; 85 FR 66199, Oct. 16, 2020; 88 FR 26215, Apr. 27, 2023]",

    "content": "(a) Notice of receipt of protest. Upon receipt of the protest, SBA will notify the contracting officer and the protestor of the date SBA received the protest and whether SBA will process the protest or dismiss it under paragraph (b) of this section. The contracting officer may award the contract after receipt of a protest if the contracting officer determines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest. Notwithstanding such a determination, the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section apply to the procurement in question.\n\n(b) Dismissal of protest. If SBA determines that the protest is premature, untimely, nonspecific, or is based on nonprotestable allegations, SBA will dismiss the protest and will send the contracting officer and the protestor a notice of dismissal, citing the reason(s) for the dismissal. Notwithstanding SBA's dismissal of the protest, SBA may, in its sole discretion, consider the protest allegations in determining whether to conduct an examination of the protested concern pursuant to subpart D of this part or submit a protest itself.\n\n(c) Notice to protested concern. If SBA determines that the protest is timely, sufficiently specific and is based upon protestable allegations, SBA will:\n\n(1) Notify the protested concern of the protest and request information and documents responding to the protest within five (5) business days from the date of the notice. These documents will include those that verify the eligibility of the concern, respond to the protest allegations, and copies of proposals or bids submitted in response to an EDWOSB or WOSB requirement. In addition, EDWOSBs will be required to submit signed copies of SBA Form 413, Personal Financial Statement, the three most recent personal income tax returns (including all schedules and W-2 forms) for the women claiming economic disadvantage and their spouses, unless the individuals and their spouses are legally separated, and SBA Form 4506-T, Request for Tax Transcript Form. SBA may draw an adverse inference where a concern fails to cooperate in providing the requested information and documents; and\n\n(2) Forward a copy of the protest to the protested concern.\n\n(d) Time period for determination. SBA will determine the EDWOSB or WOSB status of the protested concern within fifteen (15) business days after receipt of the protest, or within any extension of that time that the contracting officer may grant SBA. If SBA does not issue its determination within the fifteen (15) business day period (or within any extension of that time the contracting officer has granted), the contracting officer may award the contract if he or she determines in writing that there is an immediate need to award the contract and that waiting until SBA makes its determination will be disadvantageous to the Government. Notwithstanding such a determination, the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section apply to the procurement in question. The determination must be included in the contract file and a written copy sent to the D/GC.\n\n(e) Notification of determination. SBA will notify the contracting officer, the protestor, and the protested concern in writing of its determination. If SBA sustains the protest, SBA will issue a decision explaining the basis of its determination and requiring that the concern remove its designation in SAM (or any successor system) as an EDWOSB or WOSB, as appropriate. Regardless of a decision not to sustain the protest, SBA may, in its sole discretion, consider the protest allegations in determining whether to conduct an examination of the protested concern pursuant to subpart D of this part.\n\n(f) Effect of determination. SBA's determination is effective immediately and is final unless overturned by SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) on appeal pursuant to § 127.605.\n\n(1) A contracting officer may award the contract to a protested concern after the D/GC either has determined that the protested concern is an eligible WOSB or EDWOSB or has dismissed all protests against it. If OHA subsequently overturns the D/GC's determination or dismissal, the contracting officer may apply the OHA decision to the procurement in question.\n\n(2) A contracting officer shall not award the contract to a protested concern that the D/GC has determined is not an EDWOSB or WOSB for the procurement in question.\n\n(i) If a contracting officer receives such a determination after contract award, and no OHA appeal has been filed, the contracting officer shall terminate the award.\n\n(ii) If a timely OHA appeal has been filed after contract award, the contracting officer must consider whether performance can be suspended until an appellate decision is rendered.\n\n(iii) If OHA affirms the D/GC's determination finding that the protested concern is ineligible, the contracting officer shall either terminate the contract, not exercise the next option or not award further task or delivery orders.\n\n(3) The contracting officer must update the Federal Procurement Data System and other procurement reporting databases to reflect the final agency decision (the D/GC's decision if no appeal is filed or OHA's decision).\n\n(4) A concern that has been found to be ineligible will be decertified from the program and may not submit an offer as a WOSB or EDWOSB on another procurement until it is recertified. A concern may be recertified by reapplying to the program pursuant to § 127.305.\n\n(5) Once a final determination has been made that a concern does not meet the requirements of a WOSB or EDWOSB, the concern cannot self-certify as a WOSB or EDWOSB, as applicable, for any WOSB or EDWOSB contract. If a concern does so, it may be in violation of criminal laws, including section 16(d) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d). If the concern has already certified itself as a WOSB or EDWOSB on a pending procurement, the concern must immediately inform the contracting officer for the procuring agency of its decertification.\n\n(i) Not later than two days after the date on which a final determination is made, such concern must update its WOSB/EDWOSB status in the System for Award Management (or any successor system).\n\n(ii) If a business concern fails to update its WOSB/EDWOSB status in the System for Award Management (or any successor system) in response to the final determination, SBA will make such update within two business days of the concern's failure to do so.\n\n(iii) A concern required to make an update in the System for Award Management (or any successor system) shall notify a contracting officer for each contract with respect to which such concern has an offer or bid pending of the determination made, if the concern finds, in good faith, that such determination affects the eligibility of the concern to perform such contract.\n\n[75 FR 62282, Oct. 7, 2010, as amended at 77 FR 1861, Jan. 12, 2012; 78 FR 61148, Oct. 2, 2013; 85 FR 27665, May 11, 2020; 89 FR 96094, Dec. 4, 2024]",

In every contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, cooperative research and development agreement, or grant which is set aside, reserved, or otherwise classified as intended for award to EDWOSBs or WOSBs, there shall be a presumption of loss to the United States based on the total amount expended on the contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, cooperative research and development agreement, or grant whenever it is established that a business concern other than a EDWOSB or WOSB willfully sought and received the award by misrepresentation.\n\n(b) Deemed Certifications. The following actions shall be deemed affirmative, willful and intentional certifications of EDWOSB or WOSB status:\n\n(1) Submission of a bid, proposal, application or offer for a Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, or cooperative research and development agreement reserved, set aside, or otherwise classified as intended for award to EDWOSBs or WOSBs.\n\n(2) Submission of a bid, proposal, application or offer for a Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement or cooperative research and development agreement which in any way encourages a Federal agency to classify the bid or proposal, if awarded, as an award to a EDWOSB or WOSB.\n\n(3) Registration on any Federal electronic database for the purpose of being considered for award of a Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, or cooperative research and development agreement, as an EDWOSB or WOSB.\n\n(c) Signature Requirement.

An authorized official must sign the certification on the same page containing the EDWOSB or WOSB status claimed by the concern.\n\n(d) Limitation of Liability. Paragraphs (a)-(c) of this section may be determined not to apply in the case of unintentional errors, technical malfunctions, and other similar situations that demonstrate that a misrepresentation of EDWOSB or WOSB status was not affirmative, intentional, willful or actionable under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729, et seq. A prime contractor acting in good faith should not be held liable for misrepresentations made by its subcontractors regarding the subcontractors' EDWOSB or WOSB status. Relevant factors to consider in making this determination may include the firm's internal management procedures governing EDWOSB or WOSB status representations or certifications, the clarity or ambiguity of the representation or certification requirement, and the efforts made to correct an incorrect or invalid representation or certification in a timely manner. An individual or firm may not be held liable where government personnel have erroneously identified a concern as an EDWOSB or WOSB without any representation or certification having been made by the concern and where such identification is made without the knowledge of the individual or firm.\n\n(e) Penalties for Misrepresentation. (1) Suspension or debarment. The SBA suspension and debarment official or the agency suspension and debarment official may suspend or debar a person or concern for misrepresenting a firm's status as an EDWOSB or WOSB pursuant to the procedures set forth in 48 CFR subpart 9.4.\n\n(2) Civil Penalties. Persons or concerns are subject to severe penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3733, the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 3801-3812, and any other applicable laws or regulations, including 13 CFR part 142.\n\n(3) Criminal Penalties. Persons or concerns are subject to severe criminal penalties for knowingly misrepresenting the EDWOSB or WOSB status of a concern in connection with procurement programs pursuant to section 16(d) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d), as amended, 18 U.S.C. 1001, 18 U.S.C. 287, and any other applicable laws.

There may be no more than one permanent caregiver per service-disabled veteran with a permanent and severe disability.\n\n(1) A permanent caregiver may be appointed, in a number of ways, including:\n\n(i) By a court of competent jurisdiction;\n\n(ii) By the Department of Veterans Affairs, National Caregiver Support Program, as the Primary Family Caregiver of a Veteran participating in the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (this designation is subject to the Veteran and the caregiver meeting other specific criteria as established by law and the Secretary and may be revoked if the eligibility criteria do not continue to be met); or\n\n(iii) By a legal designation.\n\n(2) Any appointment of a permanent caregiver must in all cases be accompanied by a written determination from the Department of Veterans Affairs that the veteran has a permanent and total service-connected disability as set forth in 38 CFR 3.340 for purposes of receiving disability compensation or a disability pension. The appointment must also delineate why the permanent caregiver is given the appointment, must include the consent of the veteran to the appointment and how the appointment would contribute to managing the veteran's well-being.\n\nQualifying veteran means a veteran upon which a VOSB's eligibility is based, or in the case of an SDVOSB, a service-disabled veteran (or in the case of a veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such veteran) (as those terms are defined in this part) upon which a SDVOSB's eligibility is based.\n\nService-connected has the meaning given that term in 38 U.S.C. 101(16).\n\nService-disabled veteran means a veteran who is registered in the Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator Subsystem or successor system, maintained by Department of Veterans Affairs' Veterans Benefits Administration as a service-disabled veteran.\n\nService-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern (SDVOSB) means a small business concern that meets the requirements described in § 128.200(b).\n\nService-disabled veteran with a permanent and severe disability means a veteran with a service-connected disability that has been determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs, in writing, to have a permanent and total service-connected disability as set forth in 38 CFR 3.340 for purposes of receiving disability compensation or a disability pension.\n\nSmall business concern (SBC) means, a concern that, with its affiliates, meets the size standard corresponding to any North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code listed in its SAM profile, pursuant to part 121 of this chapter. At the time of contract offer, a VOSB or SDVOSB must be small within the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract.\n\nSurviving spouse has the meaning given the term in 38 U.S.C. 101(3).\n\nSystem for Award Management (SAM) (or any successor system) means a federal system available at www.sam.gov that consolidates various federal procurement systems (e.g., Central Contractor Registration, Federal Agency Registration, Online Representations and Certifications Application, Excluded Parties List System) and the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance into one system.\n\nVA means the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nVeteran has the meaning given such term in 38 U.S.C. 101(2). A Reservist or member of the National Guard called to Federal active duty or disabled from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty or while in training status also qualifies as a veteran.\n\nVeterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) is the set of rules, located at 48 CFR chapter 8, that specifically govern requirements exclusive to VA prime and subcontracting actions.\n\nVeteran-Owned Small Business Concern (VOSB) means a small business concern that meets the requirements described in § 128.200(a).\n\n[87 FR 73412, Nov. 29, 2022, as amended at 88 FR 42592, July 3, 2023]",

To qualify as a SDVOSB, one or more service-disabled veterans must unconditionally and directly own at least 51 percent of the concern.\n\n(a) Direct ownership. To be considered direct ownership, the qualifying veteran must own 51 percent of the concern directly, and not through another business entity or trust (including an ESOP). However, ownership by a trust, such as a living trust, may be considered direct ownership where the trust is revocable, and qualifying veterans are the grantors, trustees, and the current beneficiaries of the trust.\n\n(b) Unconditional ownership. To be considered unconditional, ownership must not be subject to any conditions, executory agreements, voting trusts, restrictions on or assignments of voting rights, or other arrangements causing or potentially causing ownership benefits to go to another (other than after death or incapacity).\n\n(1) The pledge or encumbrance of stock or other ownership interest as collateral, including seller-financed transactions, does not affect the unconditional nature of ownership if the terms follow normal commercial practices and the owner retains control absent violations of the terms.\n\n(2) In determining unconditional ownership, SBA will disregard any unexercised stock options or similar agreements held by qualifying veterans. However, any unexercised stock options or similar agreements (including rights to convert non-voting stock or debentures into voting stock) held by non-veterans will be treated as exercised, except for any ownership interests which are held by investment companies licensed under 15 U.S.C. 681 et. seq.\n\n(3) A right of first refusal granting the non-qualifying-veteran the contractual right to purchase the ownership interests of the qualifying veteran, does not affect the unconditional nature of ownership, if the terms follow normal commercial practices. If those rights are exercised by the non-qualifying-veteran, a Participant must notify SBA in accordance with § 128.307. If the exercise of those rights results in the qualifying veteran(s) owning less than 51% of the concern, SBA will initiate decertification pursuant to § 128.310.\n\n(c) Ownership of a partnership. In the case of a concern which is a partnership, one or more qualifying veterans must serve as general partners, with control over all partnership decisions. At least 51 percent of every class of partnership interest must be unconditionally owned by one or more qualifying veterans. The ownership must be reflected in the concern's partnership agreement.\n\n(d) Ownership of a limited liability company. In the case of a concern which is a limited liability company, at least 51% of each class of member interest must be unconditionally owned by one or more qualifying veterans.\n\n(e) Ownership of a corporation. In the case of a concern which is a corporation, at least 51% of the aggregate of all stock outstanding and at least 51% of each class of voting stock outstanding must be unconditionally owned by one or more qualifying veterans. In the case of a publicly-owned business, not less than 51 percent of the stock (not including any stock owned by an ESOP) must be unconditionally owned by one or more qualifying veterans.\n\n(f) Change of ownership. A Participant may change its ownership or business structure so long as one or more qualifying veterans own and control it after the change. A Participant must notify SBA of a change of ownership in accordance with § 128.307 and attest to its continued eligibility.\n\n(g) Dividends and distributions. One or more qualifying veterans must be entitled to receive:\n\n(1) At least 51 percent of any distribution of profits paid to the owners of a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company concern, and a qualifying veteran's ability to share in the profits of the concern must be commensurate with the extent of his/her ownership interest in that concern.\n\n(2) 100 percent of the value of each share of stock owned by them in the event that the stock or member interest is sold;\n\n(3) At least 51 percent of the retained earnings of the concern and 100 percent of the unencumbered value of each share of stock or member interest owned in the event of dissolution of the corporation, partnership, or limited liability company; and\n\n(h) Community property. Ownership will be determined without regard to community property laws.\n\n(i) Surviving spouse. (1) A small business concern owned and controlled by one or more service-disabled veterans immediately prior to the death of a service-disabled veteran who was the owner of the concern, the death of whom causes the concern to be less than 51 percent owned by one or more service-disabled veterans, will continue to qualify as a small business concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans during the time period specified in paragraph (i)(2) of this section if:\n\n(i) The surviving spouse of the deceased veteran acquires such veteran's ownership interest in such concern;\n\n(ii) Such veteran had a service-connected disability (as defined in 38 U.S.C. 101(16)); and\n\n(iii) For a Participant, immediately prior to the death of such veteran, and during the period described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, the small business concern is included in the certification database.\n\n(2) The time period described in paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section is the time period beginning on the date of the veteran's death and ending on the earlier of—\n\n(i) The date on which the surviving spouse remarries;\n\n(ii) The date on which the surviving spouse relinquishes an ownership interest in the small business concern;\n\n(iii) In the case of a surviving spouse of a veteran with a service-connected disability rated as 100 percent disabling or who dies as a result of a service-connected disability, 10 years after the date of the death of the veteran; or\n\n(iv) In the case of a surviving spouse of a veteran with a service-connected disability rated as less than 100 percent disabling who does not die as a result of a service-connected disability, 3 years after the date of the death of the veteran.\n\n[87 FR 73412, Nov. 29, 2022, as amended at 89 FR 102508, Dec. 17, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. To be an eligible VOSB, the management and daily business operations of the concern must be controlled by one or more veterans. To be an eligible SDVOSB, the management and daily business operations of the concern must be controlled by one or more service-disabled veterans (or in the case of a veteran with permanent and severe disability, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such veteran). Control by one or more qualifying veterans means that one or more qualifying veterans controls both the long-term decision-making and the day-to-day operations of the Applicant or Participant.\n\n(b) Managerial position and experience. A qualifying veteran must hold the highest officer position in the concern (usually President or Chief Executive Officer) and must have managerial experience of the extent and complexity needed to control the concern. The qualifying veteran need not have the technical expertise or possess the required license to be found to control of the concern if the qualifying veteran can demonstrate that he or she has ultimate managerial and supervisory control over those who possess the required licenses or technical expertise.\n\n(c) Control over a partnership. In the case of a partnership, one or more qualifying veterans must serve as general partners, with control over all partnership decisions.\n\n(d) Control over a limited liability company. In the case of a limited liability company, one or more qualifying veterans must serve as managing members, with control over all decisions of the limited liability company.\n\n(e) Control over a corporation. One or more qualifying veterans must control the Board of Directors of the concern.\n\n(1) SBA will deem qualifying veterans to control the Board of Directors where:\n\n(i) One qualifying veteran owns 100% of all voting stock and is on the Board of Directors;\n\n(ii) One qualifying veteran owns at least 51% of all voting stock, the qualifying veteran is on the Board of Directors, and no supermajority voting requirements exist for shareholders to approve corporation actions. Where supermajority voting requirements are provided for in the concern's articles of incorporation, its by-laws, or by state law, the qualifying veteran must own at least the percent of the voting stock needed to overcome any such supermajority voting requirements; or\n\n(iii) Two or more qualifying veterans together own at least 51% of all voting stock, each such qualifying veteran is on the Board of Directors, no supermajority voting requirements exist, and the qualifying veteran shareholders can demonstrate that they have made enforceable arrangements to permit one qualifying veteran to vote the stock of all qualifying veterans as a block without a shareholder meeting. Where the concern has supermajority voting requirements, the qualifying veteran shareholders must own at least that percentage of voting stock needed to overcome any such supermajority ownership requirements.\n\n(2) Where a concern does not meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the qualifying veteran(s) must control the Board of Directors through actual numbers of voting directors or, where permitted by state law, through weighted voting (e.g., in a concern having a two-person Board of Directors where one individual on the Board is a qualifying veteran and one is not, the qualifying veteran vote must be weighted—worth more than one vote—in order for the concern to be eligible). Where a concern seeks to comply with this paragraph (e)(2):\n\n(i) Provisions for the establishment of a quorum cannot permit non-qualifying-veteran Directors to control the Board of Directors, directly or indirectly; and\n\n(ii) Any Executive Committee of Directors must be controlled by qualifying veteran Directors unless the Executive Committee can only make recommendations to and cannot independently exercise the authority of the Board of Directors.\n\n(iii) Non-qualifying-veterans may be found to control or have the power to control in circumstances where non-qualifying-veterans control the Board of Directors of the Applicant or Participant, either directly through majority voting membership, or indirectly, where the by-laws allow non-qualifying-veterans to prevent a quorum or block actions proposed by the qualifying veterans.\n\n(3) Non-voting, advisory, or honorary Directors may be appointed without affecting qualifying veterans' control of the Board of Directors.\n\n(4) Arrangements regarding the structure and voting rights of the Board of Directors must comply with applicable state law.\n\n(f) Supermajority requirements. One or more qualifying veteran(s) must meet all supermajority voting requirements regarding the management and daily business operations of the concern, regardless of the legal structure of the firm.\n\n(g) Unexercised rights. Except as set forth in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a qualifying veteran's unexercised right to cause a change in the control or management of the concern does not in itself constitute control, regardless of how quickly or easily the right could be exercised.\n\n(h) Limitations on control by non-qualifying-veterans. Non-qualifying-veterans may be involved in the management of the concern and may be stockholders, partners or limited liability members of the concern. However, no non-qualifying veteran may:\n\n(1) Exercise actual control or have the power to control the concern;\n\n(2) Have business relationships that cause such dependence that the qualifying veteran cannot exercise independent business judgment without great economic risk;\n\n(3) Control the concern through loan arrangements (which does not include providing a loan guaranty on commercially reasonable terms);\n\n(4) Provide critical financial or bonding support or a critical license to the concern, which directly or indirectly allows the non-qualifying veteran to significantly influence business decisions of the qualifying veteran.\n\n(5) Be a former employer, or a principal of a former employer, of any qualifying veteran, unless the concern demonstrates that the relationship between the former employer or principal and the qualifying veteran does not give the former employer actual control or the potential to control the concern and such relationship is in the best interests of the concern; or\n\n(6) Receive compensation from the concern in any form as a director, officer, or employee, that exceeds the compensation to be received by the qualifying veteran who holds the highest officer position (usually Chief Executive Officer or President), unless the concern demonstrates that the compensation to be received by non-qualifying veteran is commercially reasonable or that the qualifying veteran has elected to take lower compensation to benefit the concern. A certified SDVOSB must notify SBA within 30 calendar days if the compensation paid to the highest-ranking officer falls below that paid to a non-qualifying veteran. In such a case, SBA must determine that that the compensation to be received by the non-qualifying veteran is commercially reasonable or that the highest-ranking officer has elected to take lower compensation to benefit the SDVOSB before SBA may determine that the concern is eligible for a SDVOSB award.\n\n(i) Limitation on outside employment. (1) A qualifying veteran generally must devote full time to the business concern during its normal hours of operations. The qualifying veteran who holds the highest officer position of the business concern may not engage in outside employment that prevents the qualifying veteran from devoting the time and attention to the concern necessary to control its management and daily business operations.\n\n(2) Where a qualifying veteran claiming to control a business concern devotes fewer hours to the business than its normal hours of operation, SBA will assume that the qualifying veteran does not control the business concern, unless the concern demonstrates that the qualifying veteran has ultimate managerial and supervisory control over both the long-term decision making and day-to-day management of the business.\n\n(3) Any qualifying veteran who seeks to engage in outside employment after certification must notify SBA of the nature and anticipated duration of the outside employment and demonstrate to SBA that the outside employment will not prevent the qualifying veteran from controlling the business concern.\n\n(j) Exception for extraordinary circumstances. SBA will not find that a lack of control exists where a qualifying veteran does not have the unilateral power and authority to make decisions regarding the following extraordinary circumstances:\n\n(1) Adding a new equity stakeholder or increasing the investment amount of an equity stakeholder;\n\n(2) Dissolution of the company;\n\n(3) Sale of the company or all assets of the company;\n\n(4) The merger of the company;\n\n(5) Company declaring bankruptcy;\n\n(6) Amendment of the company's corporate governance documents to remove the shareholder's authority to block any of the actions in paragraphs (j)(1) through (5) of this section; and\n\n(7) Any other extraordinary action that is crafted solely to protect the investment of the minority shareholders, and not to impede the majority's ability to control the concern's operations or to conduct the concern's business as it chooses.\n\n(k) Exception for active duty. Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, where a qualifying veteran is a reserve component member in the United States military who has been called to active duty, the concern may elect to designate in writing one or more individuals to control the concern on behalf of the qualifying veteran during the period of active duty. The concern must keep records evidencing the qualifying veteran's active duty status and the written designation of control and provide those documents to SBA.\n\n[87 FR 73412, Nov. 29, 2022, as amended at 88 FR 26216, Apr. 27, 2023; 89 FR 96094, Dec. 4, 2024; 89 FR 102508, Dec. 17, 2024]",

SBA will take into account any clarifications made by an Applicant in response to such a request.\n\n(c) SBA, in its sole discretion, may request additional documentation at any time in the eligibility determination process. Failure to adequately respond to the documentation request shall constitute grounds for a denial. If an Applicant does not provide requested information within the allotted time provided by SBA, or if it submits incomplete information, SBA may draw an adverse inference and presume that the information that the Applicant failed to provide would demonstrate ineligibility and deny certification on this basis.\n\n(d) An Applicant's eligibility will be based on the totality of circumstances, including facts set forth in the application, supporting documentation, any information received in response to any SBA request for clarification, and any changed circumstances. The Applicant bears the burden of proof to demonstrate its eligibility as a VOSB or SDVOSB.\n\n(1) If a concern submits inconsistent information that results in SBA's inability to determine the concern's compliance with any of the VOSB or SDVOSB eligibility requirements, SBA will decline the concern's application.\n\n(2) If, during the processing of an application, SBA determines that an applicant has knowingly submitted false information, regardless of whether correct information would cause SBA to deny the application, and regardless of whether correct information was given to SBA in accompanying documents, SBA will deny the application.\n\n(e) The Applicant must inform SBA of any changed circumstances that occur during its application review and that could affect its eligibility for the program (e.g., change in size status, ownership, or control, filing of bankruptcy, or calling to active duty) and may withdraw its application at that time. Changed circumstances will be considered by SBA in determining an Applicant's eligibility and may constitute grounds for denial of the application. The D/GC may propose decertification for any VOSB or SDVOSB that failed to inform SBA of any changed circumstances that affected its eligibility for the program during the processing of the application.\n\n(f) The decision of the D/GC to approve or deny an application will be in writing.

SBA will consider that written notice was provided if SBA sends the notice of proposed decertification to the concern at an email address in the Participant's certification database profile.\n\n(b) Response to proposed decertification. The Participant must submit a written response to the notice of proposed decertification within the timeframe specified in the notice. In this response, the Participant must rebut each of the reasons set forth by SBA in the notice of proposed decertification, and where appropriate, the rebuttal must include documents showing that the concern is eligible as of the date specified in the notice.

If SBA finds that the concern is eligible, the Participant will continue to be designated as a VOSB or SDVOSB in the certification database.\n\n(d) Decertification based on false or misleading information. (1) If SBA discovers that a VOSB/SDVOSB or its representative knowingly submitted false or misleading information, SBA will propose the firm for decertification.

For any sole source VOSB or SDVOSB award, the concern must qualify as a small business concern under the size standard corresponding to the applicable NAICS code and be a certified VOSB or SDVOSB and meet the eligibility requirements of a VOSB or SDVOSB in § 128.200 on the date of award.\n\n(b) Joint ventures. A joint venture may submit an offer for a VOSB or SDVOSB contract if the joint venture meets the requirements set forth in § 128.402.\n\n(c) Non-manufacturers. A certified VOSB or SDVOSB that is a non-manufacturer may submit an offer on a VOSB or SDVOSB contract for supplies if it meets the requirements of the non-manufacturer rule set forth at § 121.406(b)(1) of this chapter.\n\n(d) Multiple Award Contracts—(1) VOSB or SDVOSB status. With respect to Multiple Award Contracts, orders issued against a Multiple Award Contract, and Blanket Purchase Agreements issued against a Multiple Award Contract:\n\n(i) SBA determines a VOSB or SDVOSB's eligibility for the underlying Multiple Award Contract as of the date a business concern certifies its status as a certified VOSB or SDVOSB as part of its initial offer or response which includes price, unless the firm was required to recertify under § 125.12 of this chapter.\n\n(A) Unrestricted Multiple Award Contracts or set-aside Multiple Award Contracts for other than VOSB or SDVOSB. For an unrestricted Multiple Award Contract or other Multiple Award Contract not specifically set aside for VOSBs or SDVOSBs, if a business concern is a certified VOSB or SDVOSB at the time of offer and contract-level recertification for the Multiple Award Contract, it is a VOSB or SDVOSB for goaling purposes for each order issued against the contract, unless a contracting officer requests recertification as a VOSB or SDVOSB for a specific order or Blanket Purchase Agreement or a contracting officer sets aside an order exclusively for VOSBs or SDVOSBs. Except for orders and Blanket Purchase Agreements issued under any Federal Supply Schedule contract, if an order or a Blanket Purchase Agreement under an unrestricted Multiple Award Contract is set aside exclusively for VOSBs or SDVOSBs, a concern must be a certified VOSB or SDVOSB at the time it submits its initial offer or response which includes price, for the particular order or Blanket Purchase Agreement. However, where the underlying Multiple Award Contract has been awarded to a pool of concerns for which certified VOSB or SDVOSB status is required, if an order or a Blanket Purchase Agreement under that Multiple Award Contract is set aside exclusively for concerns in the certified VOSB or SDVOSB pool, concerns need not recertify their status as VOSBs or SDVOSBs (unless a contracting officer requests size certifications with respect to a specific order or Blanket Purchase Agreement).\n\n(B) VOSB or SDVOSB set-aside Multiple Award Contracts. For a Multiple Award Contract that is specifically set aside for VOSBs or SDVOSBs, if a business concern is a certified VOSB or SDVOSB at the time of offer and contract-level recertification for the Multiple Award Contract, it is a VOSB or SDVOSB for each order issued against the contract, unless a contracting officer requests recertification as a VOSB or SDVOSB for a specific order or Blanket Purchase Agreement.\n\n(ii) SBA will determine VOSB or SDVOSB status at the time of initial offer or response which includes price, for an order or an Agreement issued against a Multiple Award Contract, if the contracting officer requests a new VOSB or SDVOSB certification for the order or Agreement.\n\n(iii) For an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ), Multiple Award Contract, where concerns are not required to submit price as part of the offer for the IDIQ contract, size will be determined as of the date of initial offer, which may not include price.\n\n(2) Total set-aside contracts. The certified VOSB or SDVOSB must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see § 125.6 of this chapter) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see § 121.406(b) of this chapter), if applicable, in the performance of a contract totally set aside for VOSBs or SDVOSBs. However, contracting officers, in their discretion, may require a concern to perform the applicable amount of work or comply with the nonmanufacturer rule for each order awarded under the contract.\n\n(3) Partial set-aside contracts. For orders awarded under a partial set-aside contract, the certified VOSB or SDVOSB must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see § 125.6 of this chapter) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see § 121.406(b) of this chapter), if applicable, during each performance period of the contract (e.g., during the base term and then during each option period thereafter). For orders awarded under the non-set-aside portion, the VOSB or SDVOSB need not comply with any limitations on subcontracting or nonmanufacturer rule requirements. However, contracting officers, in their discretion, may require a concern to perform the applicable amount of work or comply with the nonmanufacturer rule for each order awarded under the contract.\n\n(4) Orders. The certified VOSB or SDVOSB must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see § 125.6 of this chapter) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see § 121.406(b) of this chapter), if applicable, in the performance of each individual order that has been set aside for VOSBs or SDVOSBs.\n\n(5) Reserves. The certified VOSB or SDVOSB must comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting provisions (see § 125.6 of this chapter) and the nonmanufacturer rule (see § 121.406(b) of this chapter), if applicable, in the performance of an order that is set aside for VOSBs or SDVOSBs. However, the VOSB or SDVOSB will not have to comply with the limitations on subcontracting provisions and the nonmanufacturer rule for any order issued against the Multiple Award Contract if the order is competed among VOSBs or SDVOSBs, and other-than-small business concerns.\n\n(e) Recertification. A prime contractor that receives an award as a certified SDVOSB must comply with the recertification requirements set forth in § 125.12 of this chapter regarding its status as a certified SDVOSB.\n\n(f) Limitations on subcontracting. A business concern seeking a VOSB or SDVOSB contract must meet the applicable limitations on subcontracting requirements set forth in § 125.6 of this chapter.\n\n(g) Ostensible subcontractor. Where a subcontractor that is not a certified VOSB or SDVOSB will perform the primary and vital requirements of a VOSB or SDVOSB contract, or where a VOSB or SDVOSB prime contractor is unduly reliant on one or more small businesses that are not certified VOSBs or SDVOSBs to perform the VOSB or SDVOSB contract, the prime contractor is not eligible for award of that VOSB or SDVOSB contract.\n\n(1) When the subcontractor qualifies as small for the size standard assigned to the procurement, this issue may be grounds for a VOSB or SDVOSB status protest, as described in § 134.1003(c) of this chapter. When the subcontractor is alleged to be other than small for the size standard assigned to the procurement, this issue may be grounds for a size protest under the ostensible subcontractor rule, as described at § 121.103(h)(2) of this chapter.\n\n(2) In the case of a contract or order for services, specialty trade construction or supplies, SBA will find that a prime VOSB or SDVOSB contractor is performing the primary and vital requirements of the contract or order, and is not unduly reliant on one or more subcontractors that are not certified VOSBs or SDVOSBs, where the prime contractor can demonstrate that it, together with any subcontractors that are certified VOSBs or SDVOSBs, will meet the limitations on subcontracting provisions set forth in § 125.6 of this chapter.\n\n(3) In a general construction contract, the primary and vital requirements of the contract are the management, supervision and oversight of the project, including coordinating the work of various subcontractors, not the actual construction work performed.\n\n(h) Two-step procurements. For purposes of architect-engineering, design-build or two-step sealed bidding procurements, a concern must be certified as a VOSB or SDVOSB as of the date that it submits its initial bid or proposal (which may or may not include price) during phase one.\n\n[87 FR 73412, Nov. 29, 2022, as amended at 88 FR 26216, Apr. 27, 2023; 88 FR 42593, July 3, 2023; 89 FR 102509, Dec. 17, 2024]",

A certified VOSB or SDVOSB may enter into a joint venture agreement with one or more other small business concerns, or with an approved mentor authorized by § 125.9 of this chapter, for the purpose of submitting an offer for a VOSB or SDVOSB contract. SBA does not certify VOSB or SDVOSB joint ventures, but the joint venture should be designated as a VOSB or SDVOSB joint venture in SAM with the VOSB or SDVOSB-certified joint venture partner identified. Where this section references the requirements of a VOSB or SDVOSB joint venture partner, the VOSB or SDVOSB status of that joint venture partner must correspond with the type of award (e.g., to be eligible for a SDVOSB contract, a SDVOSB joint venture partner must be the managing venturer of the joint venture).\n\n(1) The VOSB or SDVOSB joint venture partner must be certified in accordance with this part;\n\n(2) The joint venture agreement must comply with the requirements set forth in this part; and\n\n(3) A VOSB or SDVOSB cannot be a joint venture partner on more than one joint venture that submits an offer for a specific contract or order set-aside or reserved for VOSBs or SDVOSBs.\n\n(b) Size.

Every joint venture agreement to perform a VOSB or SDVOSB contract, including those between a protégé firm certified as a VOSB or SDVOSB and its SBA-approved mentor authorized by § 125.9 of this chapter, must contain a provision:\n\n(1) Setting forth the purpose of the joint venture;\n\n(2) Designating a certified VOSB or SDVOSB as the managing venturer of the joint venture and designating a named employee of the certified VOSB or SDVOSB managing venturer as the manager with ultimate responsibility for performance of the contract (the “Responsible Manager”);\n\n(i) The managing venturer is responsible for controlling the day-to-day management and administration of the contractual performance of the joint venture, but other partners to the joint venture may participate in all corporate governance activities and decisions of the joint venture as is commercially customary;\n\n(ii) The individual identified as the Responsible Manager of the joint venture need not be an employee of the certified VOSB or SDVOSB at the time the joint venture submits an offer, but, if he or she is not, there must be a signed letter of intent that the individual commits to be employed by the certified VOSB or SDVOSB if the joint venture is the successful offeror. The individual identified as the Responsible Manager cannot be employed by the mentor and become an employee of the certified VOSB or SDVOSB for purposes of performance under the joint venture; and\n\n(iii) Although the joint venture managers responsible for orders issued under an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract need not be employees of the protégé, those managers must report to and be supervised by the joint venture's Responsible Manager;\n\n(3) Stating that with respect to a separate legal entity joint venture, the certified VOSB or SDVOSB must own at least 51% of the joint venture entity;\n\n(4) Stating that the certified VOSB or SDVOSB must receive profits from the joint venture commensurate with the work performed by the certified VOSB or SDVOSB, or a percentage agreed to by the parties to the joint venture whereby the certified VOSB or SDVOSB receives profits from the joint venture that exceed the percentage commensurate with the work performed by the certified VOSB or SDVOSB;\n\n(5) Providing for the establishment and administration of a special bank account in the name of the joint venture. This account must require the signature or consent of all parties to the joint venture for any payments made by the joint venture to its members for services performed. All payments due the joint venture for performance on a VOSB or SDVOSB contract will be deposited in the special account; all expenses incurred under the contract will be paid from the account as well;\n\n(6) Itemizing all major equipment, facilities, and other resources to be furnished by each party to the joint venture, with a detailed schedule of cost or value of each, where practical. If a contract is indefinite in nature, such as an indefinite quantity contract or a multiple award contract where the level of effort or scope of work is not known, the joint venture must provide a general description of the anticipated major equipment, facilities, and other resources to be furnished by each party to the joint venture, without a detailed schedule of cost or value of each, or in the alternative, specify how the parties to the joint venture will furnish such resources to the joint venture once a definite scope of work is made publicly available;\n\n(7) Specifying the responsibilities of the parties with regard to negotiation of the contract, source of labor, and contract performance, including ways that the parties to the joint venture will ensure that the joint venture and the certified VOSB or SDVOSB partner(s) to the joint venture will meet the limitations on subcontracting requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, where practical. If a contract is indefinite in nature, such as an indefinite quantity contract or a multiple award contract where the level of effort or scope of work is not known, the joint venture must provide a general description of the anticipated responsibilities of the parties with regard to negotiation of the contract, source of labor, and contract performance, not including the ways that the parties to the joint venture will ensure that the joint venture and the certified VOSB or SDVOSB partner(s) to the joint venture will meet the limitations on subcontracting requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, or in the alternative, specify how the parties to the joint venture will define such responsibilities once a definite scope of work is made publicly available;\n\n(8) Obligating all parties to the joint venture to ensure performance of the VOSB or SDVOSB contract and to complete performance despite the withdrawal of any member;\n\n(9) Designating that accounting and other administrative records relating to the joint venture be kept in the office of the certified VOSB or SDVOSB managing venturer, unless approval to keep them elsewhere is granted by the District Director (or designee) upon written request;\n\n(10) Requiring that the final original records be retained by the certified VOSB or SDVOSB managing venturer upon completion of the VOSB or SDVOSB contract performed by the joint venture;\n\n(11) Stating that quarterly financial statements showing cumulative contract receipts and expenditures (including salaries of the joint venture's principals) must be submitted to SBA not later than 45 days after each operating quarter of the joint venture; and\n\n(12) Stating that a project-end profit and loss statement, including a statement of final profit distribution, must be submitted to SBA no later than 90 calendar days after completion of the contract.\n\n(d) Limitations on subcontracting. (1) For any VOSB or SDVOSB contract, including those between a protégé and a mentor authorized by § 125.9 of this chapter, the joint venture must perform the applicable percentage of work required by § 125.6 of this chapter.\n\n(2) The certified VOSB or SDVOSB partner(s) to the joint venture must perform at least 40% of the work performed by the joint venture, except that in the context of a joint venture between a protégé VOSB or SDVOSB and its SBA-approved mentor the VOSB or SDVOSB protégé must individually perform at least 40% of the work performed by the joint venture.\n\n(i) The work performed by the certified VOSB or SDVOSB partner(s) to a joint venture must be more than administrative or ministerial functions so that they gain substantive experience.\n\n(ii) The amount of work done by the partners will be aggregated and the work done by the certified VOSB or SDVOSB partners must be at least 40% of the total done by all partners. In determining the amount of work done by a non-VOSB or SDVOSB partner, all work done by the non-VOSB or SDVOSB partner and any of its affiliates at any subcontracting tier will be counted.\n\n(e) Certification of compliance—(1) At time of offer. If submitting an offer as a joint venture for a VOSB or SDVOSB contract, at the time of initial offer (and if applicable, final offer), each certified VOSB or SDVOSB joint venture partner must make the following certifications to the contracting officer separately under its own name:\n\n(i) It is a certified VOSB or SDVOSB;\n\n(ii) It, together with its affiliates, is small under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the procurement;\n\n(iii) It will comply with the applicable limitations on subcontracting during performance of the contract, as set forth in § 125.6 of this chapter.\n\n(2) Prior to identification as apparent successful offeror. (i) Prior to being identified as an apparent successful offeror for a VOSB or SDVOSB contract, the certified VOSB or SDVOSB partner to the joint venture must submit a certification to the contracting officer and SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, stating as follows:\n\n(A) The parties have entered into a joint venture agreement that fully complies with paragraph (c) of this section;\n\n(B) The parties will perform the contract in compliance with the joint venture agreement and with the limitations on subcontracting requirements set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.\n\n(ii) Although the managing venturer must be a certified VOSB or SDVOSB as of the date of the joint venture's initial offer which includes price in order for the joint venture to qualify as an eligible VOSB or SDVOSB, the joint venture must meet the joint venture agreement requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section at the time the joint venture is identified as an apparent successful offeror.\n\n(f) Capabilities, past performance, and experience. When evaluating the capabilities, past performance, experience, business systems, and certifications of an entity submitting an offer for a VOSB or SDVOSB contract as a joint venture established pursuant to this section, a procuring activity must consider work done and qualifications held individually by each partner to the joint venture as well as any work done by the joint venture itself previously. A procuring activity may not require the certified VOSB or SDVOSB to individually meet the same evaluation or responsibility criteria as that required of other offerors generally. The partners to the joint venture in the aggregate must demonstrate the past performance, experience, business systems, and certifications necessary to perform the contract.\n\n(g) Contract execution. The procuring activity will execute a VOSB or SDVOSB contract in the name of the joint venture entity or the certified VOSB or SDVOSB, but in either case will identify the award as one to a VOSB or SDVOSB joint venture or a VOSB or SDVOSB mentor-protégé joint venture, as appropriate.\n\n(h) Inspection of records. The joint venture partners must allow SBA's authorized representatives, including representatives authorized by the SBA Inspector General, during normal business hours, access to its files to inspect and copy all records and documents relating to the joint venture.\n\n(i) Performance of work reports. A certified VOSB or SDVOSB partner to a joint venture must describe how it is meeting or has met the applicable performance of work requirements for each VOSB or SDVOSB contract it performs as a joint venture.\n\n(1) The certified VOSB or SDVOSB partner to the joint venture must annually submit a report to the relevant contracting officer and to SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, explaining how and certifying that the performance of work requirements are being met.\n\n(2) At the completion of every VOSB or SDVOSB contract awarded to a joint venture, the certified VOSB or SDVOSB partner to the joint venture must submit a report to the relevant contracting officer and to SBA, signed by an authorized official of each partner to the joint venture, explaining how and certifying that the performance of work requirements were met for the contract, and further certifying that the contract was performed in accordance with the provisions of the joint venture agreement that are required under paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(3) Any person with information concerning a joint venture's compliance with the performance of work requirements may report that information to SBA and/or the SBA Office of Inspector General.\n\n(j) Basis for suspension or debarment. The Government may consider the following as a ground for suspension or debarment as a willful violation of a regulatory provision or requirement applicable to a public agreement or transaction:\n\n(1) Failure to enter a joint venture agreement that complies with paragraph (c) of this section;\n\n(2) Failure to perform a contract in accordance with the joint venture agreement or limitations on subcontracting requirements in paragraph (d) of this section; or\n\n(3) Failure to submit the certification required by paragraph (e) of this section or comply with paragraph (h) of this section.\n\n(k) Non-VOSB/SDVOSB contracts. On a non-VOSB/SDVOSB contract, for an award to a joint venture to be considered awarded to a VOSB or SDVOSB (i.e., for a procuring agency to receive VOSB or SDVOSB credit for goaling purposes), the joint venture awardee must comply with the requirements of this section and § 125.8.\n\n[87 FR 73412, Nov. 29, 2022, as amended at 88 FR 26216, Apr. 27, 2023; 88 FR 42593, July 3, 2023; 89 FR 102510, Dec. 17, 2024]",

For non-VA procurements, the contracting officer first must review a requirement to determine whether it is excluded from SDVOSB contracting pursuant to § 128.403.\n\n(b) Contracting among small business programs—(1) Acquisitions valued at or below the simplified acquisition threshold. For VA procurements, a contracting officer may award at or below the simplified acquisition threshold as set forth in the VAAR. For non-VA procurements, the contracting officer shall set aside any acquisition with an anticipated dollar value exceeding the micro-purchase threshold but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold (defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101) for small business concerns, regardless of the place of performance, when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two small business concerns that are competitive in terms of quality and delivery and award will be made at fair market prices. The requirement in this paragraph (b)(1) does not preclude a contracting officer from making an award to a small business under the 8(a) BD, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), SDVOSB, or WOSB Programs.\n\n(2) Acquisitions valued above the simplified acquisition threshold. (i) For VA procurements, a contracting officer may award above the simplified acquisition threshold as set forth in the VAAR. For non-VA procurements, the contracting officer shall set aside any acquisition with an anticipated dollar value exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold (defined in the FAR at 48 CFR 2.101) for small business concerns, regardless of the place of performance, when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two small business concerns that are competitive in terms of quality and delivery and award will be made at fair market prices. However, after conducting market research, the contracting officer shall first consider a set-aside or sole source award (if the sole source award is permitted by statute or regulation) under the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVOSB, or WOSB programs before setting aside the requirement as a small business set-aside. There is no order of precedence among the 8(a) BD, HUBZone, SDVOSB, or WOSB programs. The contracting officer must document the contract file with the rationale used to support the specific set-aside, including the type and extent of market research conducted. In addition, the contracting officer must document the contract file showing that the apparent successful offeror's certifications in the System for Award Management (SAM) (or any successor system) and associated representations were reviewed.\n\n(ii) SBA believes that progress in fulfilling the various small business goals, as well as other factors such as the results of market research, programmatic needs specific to the procuring agency, anticipated award price, and the acquisition history, will be considered in making a decision as to which program to use for the acquisition.\n\n(c) SDVOSB set-asides. If the contracting officer decides to set aside the requirement for competition restricted to SDVOSBs, the contracting officer must:\n\n(1) Have a reasonable expectation that at least two responsible SDVOSBs will submit offers; and\n\n(2) Determine that the award can be made at fair market price.\n\n(d) Prohibition on competitions requiring or favoring additional socioeconomic certifications. A procuring activity cannot restrict an SDVOSB competition (for either a contract or order) to require certifications other than SDVOSB certification (i.e., a competition cannot be limited only to business concerns that are both SDVOSB and 8(a), SDVOSB and HUBZone, or SDVOSB and WOSB) or give evaluation preferences to firms having one or more other certifications.\n\n[87 FR 73412, Nov. 29, 2022, as amended at 88 FR 26216, Apr. 27, 2023]",

All protests relating to whether an eligible VOSB or SDVOSB is a small business for purposes of any Federal program are subject to part 121 of this chapter and must be filed in accordance with that part.

In every contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, cooperative research and development agreement, or grant which is set aside, reserved, or otherwise classified as intended for award to VOSBs or SDVOSBs, there shall be a presumption of loss to the United States based on the total amount expended on the contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, cooperative research and development agreement, or grant whenever it is established that a business concern other than a VOSB or SDVOSB willfully sought and received the award by misrepresentation.\n\n(b) Deemed certifications. The following actions shall be deemed affirmative, willful, and intentional certifications of VOSB or SDVOSB status:\n\n(1) Submission of a bid, proposal, application or offer for a Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, or cooperative research and development agreement reserved, set aside, or otherwise classified as intended for award to VOSBs or SDVOSBs.\n\n(2) Submission of a bid, proposal, application or offer for a Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement or cooperative research and development agreement which in any way encourages a Federal agency to classify the bid or proposal, if awarded, as an award to a VOSB or SDVOSB.\n\n(3) Registration on any Federal electronic database for the purpose of being considered for award of a Federal grant, contract, subcontract, cooperative agreement, or cooperative research and development agreement, as a VOSB or SDVOSB.\n\n(c) Signature requirement.

Paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section may be determined not to apply in the case of unintentional errors, technical malfunctions, and other similar situations that demonstrate that a misrepresentation of VOSB or SDVOSB status was not affirmative, intentional, willful, or actionable under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729, et seq. A prime contractor acting in good faith should not be held liable for misrepresentations made by its subcontractors regarding the subcontractors' VOSB or SDVOSB status. Relevant factors to consider in making this determination may include the firm's internal management procedures governing VOSB or SDVOSB status representations or certifications, the clarity or ambiguity of the representation or certification requirement, and the efforts made to correct an incorrect or invalid representation or certification in a timely manner. An individual or firm may not be held liable where Government personnel have erroneously identified a concern as a VOSB or SDVOSB without any representation or certification having been made by the concern and where such identification is made without the knowledge of the individual or firm.\n\n(e) Penalties for misrepresentation—(1) Suspension or debarment. The SBA suspension and debarment official or the agency suspension and debarment official may suspend or debar a person or concern for misrepresenting a firm's status as a VOSB or SDVOSB pursuant to the procedures set forth in 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4.\n\n(2) Civil penalties. Persons or concerns are subject to severe penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3733, the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. 3801-3812, and any other applicable laws or regulations, including part 142 of this chapter.\n\n(3) Criminal penalties. Persons or concerns are subject to severe criminal penalties for knowingly misrepresenting the VOSB or SDVOSB status of a concern in connection with procurement programs pursuant to section 16(d) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(d), as amended, 18 U.S.C. 1001, 18 U.S.C. 287, and any other applicable laws. Persons or concerns are subject to criminal penalties for knowingly making false statements or misrepresentations to SBA for the purpose of influencing any actions of SBA pursuant to section 16(a) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 645(a), as amended, including failure to correct “continuing representations” that are no longer true.",

To be eligible to receive Federal surplus personal property, on the date of transfer a concern must:\n\n(1) Be a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans, that has been certified by SBA under this part;\n\n(2) Not be debarred, suspended, or declared ineligible under title 2 or title 48 of the CFR; and\n\n(3) Be engaged or expect to be engaged in business activities making the item useful to it.\n\n(c) Use of acquired surplus personal property.

Concerns acquiring surplus personal property from a SASP may be required to pay a service fee to the SASP in accordance with 41 CFR 102-37.280. In no instance will any SASP charge a concern more for any service than their established fees charged to other transferees.\n\n(e) Title. Upon execution of the SASP distribution document, the firm receiving the property has only conditional title to the property during the applicable period of restriction. Full title to the property will vest in the recipient concern only after the recipient concern has met all of the requirements of this part and the requirements of GSA and the SASP that it received the property from.",

The Lead Center must conduct and document annual financial and programmatic reviews and evaluations of its SBDC service centers consistent with § 130.820(a).\n\n(c) The Lead Center's and SBDC service center's services will be available to the public throughout the year during the normal hours of the business community. In addition, every effort should be made to provide assistance, including during nonbusiness hours, both in-person and virtually, as appropriate, to meet local community business demands and needs. Variations from these schedules or other anticipated closures will be included in the new or annual renewal application. Emergency closures will be reported to the SBA District Office as soon as is feasible.\n\n(d) The specific identification “Small Business Development Center” must be a part of the official name of every SBDC Lead Center and SBDC service center within the SBDC network, unless waived by the AA/SBDC.\n\n(e) Any entity that is using the term “Small Business Development Center” and under contract with the Lead Center and receiving program funds, whether receiving Federal funding or not, is considered a part of the recipient organization's network and as such the recipient organization is required to report to the OSBDC each SBDC service center's performance as well as any funds or program income generated by the activities of that Service Center.\n\n(f) Each SBDC must maintain a minimum number of export and trade certified counselors to assist clients develop export and international trade opportunities. The standard for establishing the number of counselors required to have this certification is based on the total number of full-time equivalent (FTE) counseling employees in an SBDC's network. The minimum number of certified counselors for an SBDC network is the lesser of:\n\n(1) Five counselors; or\n\n(2) Ten percent of the total number of FTE counselors in the network.\n\n(g) The Lead Center and all its SBDC service centers must implement and have in effect at all times, a uniform and enforceable conflict of interest policy applicable to all SBDC employees, contractors, consultants, and volunteers and must be signed annually.

The SBDC network, to the extent practicable, must provide prospective entrepreneurs and existing small businesses, known as clients, with counseling, access to training, and specialized services. The SBDC must create counseling records for clients when required by the cooperative agreement. The services provided must relate to the formation, financing, management, and operation of small business enterprises. The network must provide services that meet local needs as determined through periodic needs assessments, which are continually improved to keep pace with changing local small business needs. It is the responsibility of the recipient organization to change local SBDC service centers, as necessary, to meet the needs of the communities it serves in accordance with §§ 130.310 and 130.620. See section 21(c)(3) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648(c)(36)) for the full list of compulsory services. To the extent possible, SBDCs will work in collaboration with other Federal, state, tribal, and local government programs that assist small businesses and will coordinate and cooperate, to the extent practicable, with other local public and private providers of small business assistance. An SBDC Lead Center should use and compensate qualified small business vendors as one of its resources.\n\n(b) Access to Capital. (1) SBDCs must provide counseling services that increase a small business concern's access to capital, such as business plan development, financial statement preparation and analysis, and cash flow preparation and analysis.\n\n(2) SBDCs may provide assistance and guidance with the necessary documentation required for applications for capital assistance; including assistance for SBA loan products and services, including small dollar loans, free of charge as stated in § 130.470.\n\n(3) SBDCs should prepare their clients to represent themselves to lending institutions. SBDCs may attend meetings with lenders to assist clients in preparing financial packages; however, SBDCs may not attest to a client's readiness or creditworthiness to the lending institution either verbally or in writing.\n\n(4) SBDCs may participate on boards and panels of financial institutions and with outside organizations but may not be involved in any final credit decisions involving SBDC clients or in making or servicing loans.\n\n(5) With respect to SBA loan guaranty programs, SBDCs may accompany an applicant organization appearing before SBA or a lender but may not advocate for, promote, recommend approval or otherwise attempt in any manner to influence SBA or a lender to provide financial assistance to any of its clients.\n\n(c) Special emphasis initiatives. Periodically, SBA may identify, and include in the cooperative agreement, portions of the general population to be targeted for assistance by SBDCs and specific focus areas including, but not limited to: base closure assistance; cybersecurity and preparedness; employee ownership program; and intellectual property protections. (Refer to current cooperative agreement.)\n\n(d) Portable assistance. The current cooperative agreement is a startup and sustainability non-matching program to be conducted by eligible SBDCs in communities that are economically challenged as a result of a business or government facility downsizing or closing, which has resulted in the loss of jobs or small business instability. The funds will be used for small business development center personnel expenses and related small business programs and services.\n\n[60 FR 31056, June 13, 1995.

Such offsetting funds may be applied to Federal or matching accounts.\n\n(h) The following sources cannot be used as matching funds for the SBDC network:\n\n(1) Uncompensated student labor;\n\n(2) SCORE, SBA, Women's Business Centers, or other SBA resource partners;\n\n(3) Program income or fees collected from individuals or small businesses receiving assistance;\n\n(4) Federal funds other than Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds;\n\n(5) In-kind contributions, or indirect costs not solely dedicated to the SBDC Program, or under its control;\n\n(6) Any resource allocated and claimed as a matching cost to another federally funded program; or\n\n(7) Funds or other resources provided for an agreed upon scope of work inconsistent with the authorized activities of the SBDC Program.\n\n[60 FR 31056, June 13, 1995, as amended at 88 FR 76645, Nov. 7, 2023; 89 FR 17717, Mar. 12, 2024]",

    "content": "(a) General. The SBDC Lead Center Director, as a part of the annual renewal proposal, or the applicant organization's authorized representative, in the case of a new SBDC application, shall prepare and submit to the SBA Project Officer the budget justification for the upcoming budget period. The budget will be reviewed annually upon submission of a renewal application.\n\n(b) Direct costs. At least 80 percent of SBA funding must be allocated to the direct cost of program delivery.\n\n(c) Indirect costs. If the applicant organization or recipient organization waives all indirect costs, then 100 percent of SBA funding must be allocated to program delivery. If the reimbursements of some, but not all, indirect costs are waived to meet the matching funds requirement, the lesser of the following may be allocated as reimbursed indirect costs of the Program and charged against the Federal contribution:\n\n(1) Twenty percent of Federal contribution; or\n\n(2) The amount remaining after the waived portion of indirect costs is deducted from the total indirect costs allowed by the SBA.\n\n(d) Separate SBDC service provider budgets. The applicant organization shall include separate budgets for all SBDC service providers in conformity with 2 CFR part 220, appendix A. Applicable direct cost categories and indirect cost base/rate agreements will be included for the Lead Center and all SBDC service providers, using a rate equal to or less than the negotiated predetermined rate. If no such rate exists, the sponsoring SBDC organization or SBDC service provider will negotiate a rate with its cognizant agency. In the event the sponsoring SBDC organization or SBDC service provider does not have a cognizant agency, the rate shall be, in accordance with OMB guidelines:\n\n(1) Negotiated with the SBA Project Officer; or\n\n(2) Apply the OMB de minimis rate.\n\n(e) Cost principles. Principles for determining allowable costs are contained in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E.\n\n(f) Salaries. (1) Where the recipient organization is an educational institution, the salaries of the SBDC Lead Center Director and the SBDC Service Center Director at a minimum must approximate the average annualized salary of a full professor and an assistant professor, respectively, in the school or department in which the SBDC is located. If a recipient organization is not an educational institution, the salaries of the SBDC Lead Center Director and the subcenter Directors must approximate the average salaries of parallel positions within the recipient organization. In both cases, the recipient organization should consider the Director's longevity in the Program, the number of subcenters, the size of the SBDC budget, the number of service centers, and the individual's experience and background when determining the salary.\n\n(2) Salaries for Lead Center Directors should be comparable to salaries paid Lead Center Directors in other states or regions with comparably sized programs, responsibilities, and authority.\n\n(3) Salaries for all other positions within the SBDC should be based upon level of responsibility and be comparable to salaries for similar positions in the area served by the SBDC.\n\n(g) Equipment. In accordance with 2 CFR part 200, capital expenditures for equipment must have the prior approval of the Program Manager of the OSBDC, either through a specific disclosure in an annual cost proposal or through an approved amendment to an existing cooperative agreement.\n\n(h) Travel. (1) All travel must be separately identified in the proposed budget under the categories of: planned in-state/region, planned out-of-state/region, unanticipated in-state/region, or unanticipated out-of-state/region. Unplanned travel estimates may be based on the SBDC's experience.\n\n(2) Transportation costs must be justified in writing, including the estimated cost, number of persons traveling, and the benefit to be derived by the small business community from the proposed travel.\n\n(3) Any proposed unplanned out-of-state/region travel exceeding the approved amount budgeted for this category must be submitted to the SBA for approval on a case-by-case basis prior to traveling.\n\n(4) All foreign travel requests must be submitted to the appropriate District Director and the SBDC Program Manager for review and provided to the AA/SBDC for final approval in accordance with the notice of funding opportunity. Foreign travel charged to the SBDC cooperative agreement or performed by SBDC staff, while on duty for the recipient organization, must be approved in advance.\n\n(i) Planned foreign travel costs allocable to the SBDC cooperative agreement for SBDC network staff may be approved by AA/SBDC through the annual proposal process, but such planned costs must be fully disclosed and justified in the budget narrative for Agency review. Prior approval should be obtained from the AA/SBDC prior to travel in accordance with 2 CFR part 200.\n\n(ii) Unanticipated foreign travel must be approved using the process set forth in this paragraph (h).\n\n[88 FR 76646, Nov. 7, 2023]",

    "content": "(a) General. After entering into a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization, the SBA may take, as it determines appropriate, any of the following actions based upon one or more of the circumstances listed in paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(1) Non-renewal. The AA/SBDC may elect not to renew a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization at any point. In undertaking a nonrenewal action, the AA/SBDC may either choose not to accept or consider any application for renewal from the recipient organization or the Agency may choose not to exercise option years remaining under the cooperative agreement. When a cooperative agreement is not renewed, the recipient organization may continue to conduct project activities and incur allowable expenses until the end of the current budget period. If a recipient organization decides to not seek to renew its grant, it must notify the District Office and send a letter of intent to withdraw to the AA/SBDC as soon as it is feasible.\n\n(2) Suspension. (i) The AA/SBDC may suspend a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization at any point. A decision to suspend a cooperative agreement is effective immediately. The suspension of a recipient organization begins on the date the notice of suspension is issued, and the period of suspension will last no longer than six months. At the end of the period of suspension or at any point during that period, the AA/SBDC will either reinstate the cooperative agreement or commence an action for termination or non-renewal.\n\n(ii) The notice of suspension will recommend that the recipient organization cease work on the project immediately. The SBA is under no obligation to reimburse any expenses incurred by a recipient organization while its cooperative agreement is under suspension. Where AA/SBDC decides to lift a suspension and reinstate a recipient organization's cooperative agreement, the Agency may, at its discretion, choose to reimburse a recipient organization for some or all of the expenses it incurred in furtherance of project objectives during the period of suspension. However, there is no guarantee that the Agency will elect to accept such expenses, and recipient organizations incurring expenses while under suspension do so at their own risk.\n\n(b) Cause. The AA/SBDC may terminate, elect not to renew, or suspend a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization for cause. The cause may include, but is not limited to the following:\n\n(1) Non-performance;\n\n(2) Poor performance;\n\n(3) Unwillingness or inability to implement changes to improve performance;\n\n(4) Disregard or material violation of regulations;\n\n(5) Willful or material failure to comply with the terms of the cooperative agreement, including relevant OMB Circulars;\n\n(6) Conduct of the SBDC Lead Center Director or other key personnel, reflecting a lack of business integrity or honesty, which is not properly addressed on the part of the recipient organization or sponsoring SBDC organizations;\n\n(7) A conflict of interest on the part of the recipient organization, the SBDC service centers, the SBDC Lead Center Director, other key personnel, contractors or volunteers that causes a real or perceived detriment to a small business concern, a contractor, the SBDC network, including but not limited to, SBDC service centers, or SBA;\n\n(8) Improper use of Federal funds;\n\n(9) Failure of a Lead Center or its service centers to consent to audits, examinations, certification reviews, or to maintain required documents or records;\n\n(10) Failure to implement recommendations from the audits or examinations within one year of notification of deficiencies;\n\n(11) Failure to implement conditions from accreditation reviews within the time frame recommended by the accreditation committee and established by the AA/SBDC;\n\n(12) Failure of the SBDC Lead Center Director to work at the SBDC Lead Center on a full-time basis;\n\n(13) Failure to promptly suspend or terminate the employment of an SBDC Lead Center Director, Service Center Director, or other key personnel, contractors, or volunteers upon receipt of knowledge or written information by the recipient organization and/or SBA indicating that such individual has engaged in conduct which may result or has resulted in a criminal conviction or civil judgment that would cause the public to question the SBDC's integrity. The SBDC Lead Center Director (or other appropriate official in the SBDC network), when making the decision to suspend or terminate such an employee, must consider the magnitude of the behavior, the repetitiveness of the conduct, and the remoteness in time of the behavior underlying any conviction or judgment;\n\n(14) Failure to maintain adequate client service facilities or service hours; and\n\n(15) Any other action that materially and adversely affects the operation or integrity of an SBDC or the SBDC Program.\n\n(c) Administrative procedure for suspension, termination, and nonrenewal. These procedures apply to termination, non-renewal, and suspension of cooperative agreements with recipient organizations.\n\n(1) Taking action. When the Program Manager has reason to believe that there is cause to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization, either based on their own knowledge or upon information provided by other parties, the AA/SBDC may undertake an enforcement action by issuing a written notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal to the recipient organization. The effects of such notice are addressed in paragraph (a) of this section.\n\n(2) Notice requirements. Each notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal will set forth the specific facts and reasons for the AA/SBDC's decision and will include reference to the appropriate legal authority. The notice will also advise the recipient organization that it has the right to request an administrative review of the decision to suspend, terminate, or non-renew its cooperative agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. The notice will be transmitted electronically, via email, to the recipient organization on the same date it is issued by mail.\n\n(3) Relationship to Government-wide suspension and debarment. A decision by the AA/SBDC to suspend, terminate, or not renew an SBDC cooperative agreement does not constitute a non-procurement suspension or debarment of a recipient organization under Executive Order 12549, Debarment and Suspension, and SBA's implementation of OMB regulations at 2 CFR part 2700. However, a decision by the AA/SBDC to undertake a suspension, termination, or non-renewal enforcement action with regard to a particular SBDC cooperative agreement does not preclude or preempt the Agency from also taking action to suspend or debar a recipient organization for purposes of all Federal procurement and/or non-procurement opportunities.\n\n(d) Administrative review of suspension, termination and nonrenewal actions. When the AA/SBDC has suspended, terminated, or elected not to renew a cooperative agreement, the recipient organization has the right to request an administrative review of the enforcement action. Administrative review of the AA/SBDC's enforcement actions will be conducted by the Associate Administrator for Entrepreneurial Development (AA/ED).\n\n(1) Format. There is no prescribed format for a request for an administrative review of an SBA enforcement action. While a recipient organization has the right to retain legal counsel to represent its interests in connection with an administrative review, it is under no obligation to do so. Formal briefs and other technical forms of pleading are not required. However, a request for an administrative review of an SBA enforcement action must be in writing, should be concise and logically arranged, and must at a minimum include the following information:\n\n(i) Name and address of the recipient organization;\n\n(ii) Identification of the relevant SBA office/program (i.e., Office of Small Business Development Centers/Small Business Development Center Program);\n\n(iii) Cooperative agreement number;\n\n(iv) Copy of the notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal;\n\n(v) Statement discussing why the recipient organization believes the SBA's actions were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and/or otherwise not in accordance with the law or governing regulations;\n\n(vi) Identification of the specific relief being sought (e.g., lifting of the suspension);\n\n(vii) Statement as to whether the recipient organization is requesting a hearing, and if so, the reasons why it believes a hearing is necessary; and\n\n(viii) Copies of any documents or other evidence the recipient organization believes support its position.\n\n(2) Service. Any recipient organization requesting an administrative review of an SBA enforcement action must submit copies of its request (including any attachments) to:\n\n(i) AA/SBDC; and\n\n(ii) the Associate General Counsel for Procurement Law.\n\n(3) Timeliness. To be considered timely, the AA/ED must receive a request for an administrative review from the recipient organization within 30 days of the date of the notice of termination, non-renewal, or suspension. Any request for administrative review received by the AA/ED more than 30 days after the date of the notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal will be considered untimely and will be rejected without being considered.\n\n(i) In addition, if the AA/ED does not receive a request for an administrative review within the 30-day deadline, then the decision by the AA/SBDC to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a recipient organization's cooperative agreement will become the final Agency decision on the matter.\n\n(ii) [Reserved]\n\n(4) Standard of review. In order to have the suspension, termination, or non-renewal of a cooperative agreement reversed on an administrative review, a recipient organization must successfully demonstrate that the SBA enforcement action was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and/or otherwise not in accordance with the law or governing regulations.\n\n(5) Conduct of the proceeding. Each party must serve the opposing party with copies of all requests, arguments, evidence, and any other filings it submits pursuant to the administrative review. Within 30 days of the AA/ED receiving a request for an administrative review, the AA/ED must also receive the SBA's arguments and evidence in defense of its decision to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a recipient organization's cooperative agreement. If the SBA fails to provide its arguments and evidence in a timely manner, the administrative review will be conducted solely on the basis of the information provided by the recipient organization. After receiving the SBA's response to the request for an administrative review or after the passage of the 30-day deadline for filing such a response, the AA/ED will take one or more of the following actions, as applicable:\n\n(i) Notify the parties whether the AA/ED has decided to grant a request for a hearing.\n\n(ii) Direct the parties to submit further arguments and/or evidence on any issues, that she/he believes require clarification.\n\n(iii) Notify the parties that the AA/ED has declared the record to be closed and therefore will refuse to admit any further evidence or argument.\n\n(iv) Within ten calendar days of declaring the record to be closed, provide all parties with a copy of the AA/ED's written decision on the merits of the administrative review.\n\n(6) Request for hearing. The AA/ED will only grant a request for a hearing if she/he concludes that there is a genuine dispute as to a material fact that cannot be resolved except by the taking of testimony and the confrontation of witnesses. If the AA/ED grants a request for a hearing, they will set the time and place for the hearing, determine whether the hearing will be conducted in person, via telephone or virtually, and identify which witnesses will be permitted to give testimony.\n\n(7) Evidence. The recipient organization and SBA each have the right to submit whatever evidence they believe is relevant to the matter in dispute. No form of evidence will be permitted unless a party has made a substantial showing, based upon credible evidence and not mere allegation, that the other party has acted in bad faith or engaged in improper behavior.\n\n(8) Decision. The decision of the AA/ED will be effective immediately as of the date it is issued. The decision of the AA/ED will represent the final Agency decision on all matters in dispute on administrative review. No further relief may be sought from or granted by the Agency. If the AA/ED determines that the SBA's decision to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a cooperative agreement was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and/or otherwise not in accordance with the law, she/he will reverse the Agency's enforcement action and direct the SBA to reinstate the recipient organization's cooperative agreement.\n\n(i) Where an enforcement action has been reversed on administrative review, the SBA will have no more than ten calendar days to implement the AA/ED's decision. However, to the extent permitted under the applicable OMB Circulars, the SBA reserves the right to impose such special conditions in the recipient organization's cooperative agreement as it deems necessary to protect the Government's interests.\n\n(ii) [Reserved]\n\n[88 FR 76648, Nov. 7, 2023]",

The WBC is not prohibited from operating other Federal programs that focus on women or other underserved small business concerns if doing so does not hinder its ability to deliver the services of the WBC program.\n\n(d) The WBC must have facilities and administrative infrastructure sufficient for its operations, including program development, program management, financial management, reports management, promotion and public relations, program assessment, program evaluation, and internal quality control. The WBC must document annual financial and programmatic reviews and evaluations of its center(s) consistent with Agency policy.\n\n(e) Any new applicant that is accepted into the WBC program after January 24, 2020 must include as part of its official name the specific identification “Women's Business Center.” For the purpose of the WBC program, the official name used is the name assigned to the WBC by the host organization.

Once the SBA has entered into a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization, the area of service cannot be changed without prior approval by the AA/OWBO. A subsequent decision by the recipient organization to change the area of service in the cooperative agreement without prior approval by OWBO may constitute grounds for suspension, non-renewal, and/or termination as set forth in § 131.830.\n\n(b) Location of WBC projects. An applicant organization responding to a program announcement and within proximity of an existing WBC project shall provide in its written narrative a justification for placing another WBC in the proximity of an existing WBC, including the number of socially and economically disadvantaged persons within the proposed service area, relevant census data, and information on population density. The information provided must clearly justify the necessity for an additional WBC project within the same area of service as the existing WBC project. The SBA will take the narrative and any supporting documentation into consideration when reviewing, ranking, and scoring the applicant organization's proposal.\n\n(c) Resources.

Any fees so generated will constitute program income. The WBC must ensure that these services are not credited to both the WBC program and any other Federally-funded program, thereby double counting the efforts.\n\n(3) WBCs shall prepare their clients to represent themselves to lending institutions. WBC personnel may attend meetings with lenders to assist clients in preparing financial packages; however, neither WBC staff nor their agents may take a direct or indirect role in representing clients in any loan negotiations.\n\n(4) WBCs shall disclose to their clients that financial counseling assistance, including loan packaging, will not guarantee receipt or imply approval of a loan or loan guarantee.\n\n(5) WBCs must not intervene in loan decisions, service loans, make credit recommendations, or otherwise influence decisions regarding the award of any loans or lines of credit on behalf of the WBC's clients, unless the WBC operates as an SBA Microloan Intermediary and is awarding an individual or small business concern an SBA microloan.\n\n(6) When the recipient organization operates both a WBC and a separate loan program, the WBC must disclose to the client other financing options that may be available besides the one offered by the recipient organization to ensure that the client has the opportunity to seek financing outside of the recipient organization. If the recipient organization operates an SBA loan program, it must comply with § 120.140 of this chapter.\n\n(7) WBCs must disclose to loan packaging clients any financial relationships between the WBC and a lender or the sale of their credit products.\n\n(8) With respect to loan programs, allowable activities include the following: assisting clients in formulating a business plan, preparing financial statements, completing forms that are part of a loan application, and accompanying an applicant appearing before the SBA or other lenders.

Where the AA/OWBO decides to lift a suspension and reinstate a recipient organization's cooperative agreement, the Agency may, at its discretion, choose to make funds available to reimburse a recipient organization for some or all of the expenses it incurred in furtherance of project objectives during the period of suspension. However, there is no guarantee that the Agency will elect to accept such expenses and recipient organizations incurring expenses while under suspension do so at their own risk.\n\n(2) Termination. (i) The AA/OWBO may terminate a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization at any point. A decision to terminate a cooperative agreement is effective immediately as of the date of the notice of termination. A recipient organization may not incur further obligations under the cooperative agreement after the date of termination unless it has been expressly authorized to do so in the notice of termination.\n\n(ii) Funds remaining under the cooperative agreement may be made available by the AA/OWBO to satisfy financial obligations properly incurred by the recipient organization prior to the date of termination. Award funds will not be available for obligations incurred subsequent to the effective date of termination unless expressly authorized under the notice of termination. A recipient organization that has had its cooperative agreement terminated will have 90 days to submit final closeout documents as instructed by the SBA.\n\n(3) Non-renewal. (i) The AA/OWBO may elect not to renew a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization at any point. In undertaking a non-renewal action, the SBA may either decline to accept or consider any application for renewal the organization submits, or the agency may decline to exercise any option years remaining under the cooperative agreement. A recipient organization that has had its cooperative agreement non-renewed may continue to conduct project activities and incur allowable expenses until the end of the current budget period.\n\n(ii) Funds remaining under a non-renewed cooperative agreement may be utilized to satisfy financial obligations the recipient organization properly incurred prior to the end of the budget period. Award funds will not be available for obligations incurred subsequent to the end of the current budget period. A recipient organization that has had its cooperative agreement non-renewed will have until the end of the current budget period or 120 days, whichever is longer, to conclude its operations and submit closeout documents as instructed by the SBA.\n\n(b) Material non-compliance. The AA/OWBO may suspend, terminate, or not renew a cooperative agreement, in whole or in part, with a recipient organization for material non-compliance (frequently referred to as for cause). Material non-compliance may include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n(1) Non-performance;\n\n(2) Poor performance;\n\n(3) Unwillingness or inability to implement changes to improve performance;\n\n(4) Willful or material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement, including relevant Office of Management and Budget circulars;\n\n(5) Conduct reflecting a lack of business integrity or honesty on the part of the recipient organization, the WBC Program Director, or other significant employee(s), which has not been properly addressed;\n\n(6) A conflict of interest on the part of the recipient organization, the WBC Program Director, or other significant employees causing real or perceived detriment to a small business concern, a contractor, the WBC, or the SBA;\n\n(7) Improper management or use of Federal funds;\n\n(8) Failure of a WBC to consent to audits or examinations, or to maintain required documents or records;\n\n(9) Failure to implement recommendations from the audits or examinations within 30 days of their receipt;\n\n(10) Failure of the WBC Program Director to work at the WBC on a 100 percent full-time basis on the WBC project;\n\n(11) Failure to promptly suspend or terminate the employment of a WBC Program Director, or other significant employee, upon receipt of knowledge or written information by the recipient organization and/or the SBA indicating that such individual has engaged in conduct, which may result or has resulted in a criminal conviction or civil judgment which would cause the public to question the WBC's integrity. In making the decision to suspend or terminate such an employee, the recipient organization must consider such factors as the magnitude and repetitiveness of the harm caused and the remoteness in time of the behavior underlying any conviction or judgment;\n\n(12) Failure to maintain adequate client service facilities or service hours;\n\n(13) Fraud, waste, abuse, mismanagement or criminal activity on the part of the recipient organization and/or its staff/employees; or\n\n(14) Any other action that the AA/OWBO believes materially and adversely affects the operation or integrity of a WBC or the WBC program.\n\n(c) Procedures. The same procedures will apply regardless of whether a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization is being suspended, terminated, or non-renewed by the SBA.\n\n(1) Taking action. When the AA/OWBO has reason to believe there is cause to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a cooperative agreement with a recipient organization (either based on its own knowledge or upon information provided to it by other parties), the AA/OWBO may undertake such an enforcement action by issuing a written notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal to the recipient organization.\n\n(2) Notice requirements. Each notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal will set forth the specific facts and reasons for the AA/OWBO decision and will include reference to the appropriate legal authority. The notice will also advise the recipient organization that it has the right to request an administrative review of the decision to suspend, terminate, or non-renew its cooperative agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. The notice will be transmitted to the recipient organization on the same date it is issued by both U.S. Mail and facsimile or as an email attachment.\n\n(3) Relationship to government-wide suspension and debarment. A decision by the AA/OWBO to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a WBC cooperative agreement does not constitute a nonprocurement suspension or debarment of a recipient organization under Executive Order 12549 and SBA's implementing regulations (2 CFR part 2700). However, a decision by the AA/OWBO to undertake a suspension, termination, or non-renewal enforcement action with regard to a particular WBC cooperative agreement does not preclude or preempt the Agency from also taking action to suspend or debar a recipient organization for purposes of all Federal procurement and/or nonprocurement opportunities.\n\n(d) Administrative review. Any recipient organization that has had its cooperative agreement suspended, terminated, or non-renewed has the right to request an administrative review of the AA/OWBO's enforcement action. Administrative review of WBC enforcement actions will be conducted by the AA/OED.\n\n(1) Format. There is no prescribed format for a request for administrative review of an SBA enforcement action. While a recipient organization has the right to retain legal counsel to represent its interests in connection with an administrative review, it is under no obligation to do so. Formal briefs and other technical forms of pleading are not required. However, a request for administrative review of an SBA enforcement action must be in writing, should be concise and logically arranged, and must at a minimum include the following information:\n\n(i) Name and address of the recipient organization;\n\n(ii) Identification of the relevant SBA office/program (i.e., OWBO/WBC Program);\n\n(iii) Cooperative agreement number;\n\n(iv) Copy of the notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal;\n\n(v) Statement regarding why the recipient organization believes the SBA's actions were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and/or otherwise not in accordance with the law;\n\n(vi) Identification of the specific relief being sought (e.g., lifting of the suspension);\n\n(vii) Statement as to whether the recipient organization is requesting a hearing and, if so, the reasons why it believes a hearing is necessary; and\n\n(viii) Copies of any documents or other evidence the recipient organization believes support its position.\n\n(2) Service. Any recipient organization requesting administrative review of an SBA enforcement action must submit copies of its request (including any attachments) to all of the following parties:\n\n(i) Associate Administrator for the Office of Entrepreneurial Development, U.S. Small Business Administration;\n\n(ii) Assistant Administrator for the Office of Women's Business Ownership U.S. Small Business Administration;\n\n(iii) Associate General Counsel for Procurement Law, U.S. Small Business Administration.\n\n(e) Timeliness. (i) In order to be considered timely, the AA/OED must receive a recipient organization's request for administrative review within 30 days of the date of the notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal. Any request for administrative review received by the AA/OED more than 30 days after the date of the notice of suspension, termination, or non-renewal will be considered untimely and will automatically be rejected without being considered.\n\n(ii) In addition, if the AA/OED does not receive a request for administrative review within the 30-day deadline, then the decision by the AA/OWBO to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a recipient organization's cooperative agreement will automatically become the final Agency decision on the matter.\n\n(f) Standard of review. In order to have the suspension, termination, or non-renewal of a cooperative agreement reversed on administrative review, a recipient organization must successfully demonstrate that the SBA enforcement action was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and/or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\n\n(g) Conduct of the proceeding. (1) Each party must serve the opposing party with copies of all requests, arguments, evidence, and any other filings it submits pursuant to the administrative review. Within 30 days of the AA/OED receiving a request for administrative review, the AA/OED must also receive the SBA's arguments and evidence in defense of its decision to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a recipient organization's cooperative agreement. If the SBA fails to provide its arguments and evidence in a timely manner, the administrative review will be conducted solely on the basis of the information provided by the recipient organization.\n\n(2) After receiving the SBA's response to the request for administrative review or the passage of the 30-day deadline for filing such a response, the AA/OED will take one or more of the following actions, as applicable:\n\n(i) Notify the parties whether she/he has decided to grant a request for a hearing;\n\n(ii) Direct the parties to submit further arguments and/or evidence on any issues which she/he believes require clarification; and/or\n\n(iii) Notify the parties that she/he has declared the record to be closed and therefore she/he will refuse to admit any further evidence or argument.\n\n(3) The AA/OED will only grant a request for a hearing if she/he concludes that there is a genuine dispute as to a material fact that cannot be resolved except by the taking of testimony and the confrontation of witnesses. If the AA/OED grants a request for a hearing, she/he will set the time and place for the hearing, determine whether the hearing will be conducted in person or via telephone, and identify which witnesses will be permitted to give testimony.\n\n(4) Within 10 calendar days of declaring the record to be closed, the AA/OED will provide all parties with a copy of her/his written decision on the merits of the administrative review.\n\n(h) Evidence. The recipient organization and the SBA each have the right to submit whatever evidence they believe is relevant to the matter in dispute. No form of discovery will be permitted unless a party has made a substantial showing, based upon credible evidence and not mere allegation that the other party has acted in bad faith or engaged in improper behavior.\n\n(i) Decision. (1) The decision of the AA/OED will be effective immediately as of the date it is issued. The decision of the AA/OED will represent the final Agency decision on all matters in dispute on administrative review. No further relief may be sought from or granted by the Agency. If the AA/OED determines that the SBA's decision to suspend, terminate, or non-renew a cooperative agreement was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and/or otherwise not in accordance with the law, she/he will reverse the Agency's enforcement action and direct the SBA to reinstate the recipient organization's cooperative agreement.\n\n(2) Where an enforcement action has been reversed on administrative review, the SBA will have no more than 10 calendar days to implement the AA/OED's decision. However, to the extent permitted under the applicable Office of Management and Budget circulars, the SBA reserves the right to impose such special conditions in the recipient organization's cooperative agreement as it deems necessary to protect the government's interests.",

(1) A recipient organization wishing to resolve a dispute regarding a financial or programmatic matter other than suspension, termination, or non-renewal of its award must submit a written appeal petition describing the subject of the dispute, along with any relevant documentation, to the Chairman of the grant appeals committee (the Committee).\n\n(2) The appeal petition must be received by the Committee within 30 calendar days of the date of SBA's decision. A copy of the appeal petition must also be provided to the AA/OWBO.\n\n(3) There is no prescribed format for the submission of an appeal petition. Formal briefs and other technical forms of pleading are not required, nor is the grantee required to obtain civil representation. However, the appeal petition must be in writing and must be concise, factual, and logically arranged. In addition, the appeal petition must contain the following:\n\n(i) Name and address of organization; (ii) Name and address of the appropriate local SBA district office;\n\n(iii) Identification of the appropriate SBA program office and the award number;\n\n(iv) A statement of the material which are substantially in dispute;\n\n(v) Copies of any documents or other evidence supporting the appeal;\n\n(vi) A request for the specific relief desired on appeal: and\n\n(vii) A statement as to whether an oral hearing is being requested and, if so, the reason for the hearing.\n\n(4) The Committee will first rule on a request for an oral hearing before proceeding to consider the merits of an appeal petition. Within 60 calendar days of receiving the appeal petition, the Committee will present its decision in writing to the recipient organization and the AA/OWBO. The Committee's ruling will represent the final Agency decision on the subject of the dispute and will not be further appealable within SBA.\n\n(5) Requests for an appeal before the Committee will not be granted unless the Agency determines there are substantial material facts in dispute.\n\n(6) The Committee may request additional information or documentation from the recipient organization at any stage in the proceedings. The recipient organization's response to the Committee's request for additional information or documentation must be submitted, in writing, to the Committee within 15 calendar days of receipt of the request. In the event that the recipient organization fails to follow the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the Committee may dismiss the appeal by a written order.\n\n(7) If a request for an appeal is granted, the Committee will provide the recipient organization with written instructions and will afford the parties an opportunity to present their positions to the Committee in writing.\n\n(8) The chairperson of the Committee, with advice from the SBA's Office of General Counsel, will issue a final written decision within 30 calendar days of receipt of all information or inform the recipient organization that additional time to issue a decision is necessary. A copy of the decision will be transmitted to the recipient organization, with copies to the AA/OWBO.\n\n(9) At any time within 120 days of the end of the budget period, the recipient organization may submit a written request to use an expedited dispute appeal process. The Committee, by an affirmative vote of a majority of its total membership, may expedite the appeals process to attain final resolution of a dispute before the issuance date of a new cooperative agreement.\n\n(b) [Reserved]",

Closeout procedures are used to ensure that the WBC program funds and property acquired or developed under the WBC cooperative agreement are fully reconciled and transferred seamlessly between the recipient organization and other Federal programs.

(1) An appeal petition should be on 8.5″ × 11″ paper with a clear type at least 12 point in size. Preferably, double-space the main text and use 1″ margins all around. Number each page. A separate cover letter is not needed. A table of contents is optional. Hard copies of documents sent by facsimile or electronic mail are not needed unless specifically requested.\n\n(2) The maximum length of an appeal petition (not including attachments) is 20 pages, unless prior leave is sought by the petitioner and granted by the Judge. A table of authorities is required only for petitions citing more than twenty cases, regulations, or statutes.\n\n(3) Clearly label any exhibits and attachments. Do not include documents already submitted to SBA in connection with the matter being appealed. SBA will submit these directly to OHA.\n\n(e) Motion for a more definite appeal petition. A respondent, SBA, or a contracting officer (for NAICS appeals) may, not later than five days after receiving a petition, move for an order to the petitioner to provide a more definite appeal petition or otherwise comply with this section. A Judge may order a more definite appeal petition on his or her own initiative.\n\n(1) A motion for a more definite appeal petition stays the respondent's time for filing an answer or response. The Judge will establish the time for filing and serving an answer or response.\n\n(2) If the petitioner does not comply with the Judge's order to provide a more definite appeal petition or otherwise fails to comply with applicable regulations, the Judge may dismiss the petition with prejudice.\n\n(f) Notice and Order. After an appeal petition is filed, OHA will issue a Notice and Order and serve it upon all known parties (or their attorneys). If a party does not receive a Notice and Order, it should contact OHA.\n\n[67 FR 47247, July 18, 2002, as amended at 75 FR 47439, Aug. 6, 2010]",

    "content": "All pleadings or other submissions must be filed with OHA and served on all other parties or their attorneys. Each submission requires a certificate of service.\n\n(a) Methods of filing and service. E-mail, mail, delivery, and facsimile are all permitted unless a Judge orders otherwise.\n\n(1) E-mail constitutes any system for sending and receiving messages electronically over a telecommunications network. The sender is responsible for ensuring that e-mail software and file formats are compatible with the recipient and for a successful, virus-free transmission.\n\n(2) Mail includes any service provided by the U.S. Postal Service. Mail (except “Express Mail”) is not recommended for time-sensitive filings.\n\n(3) Delivery is personal delivery by a party, its employee, its attorney, or a commercial delivery service.\n\n(4) Facsimile submissions should not exceed 30 pages. Contact OHA before faxing longer submissions. Follow-up originals or “hard copies” are not required unless OHA or another party specifically requests them.\n\n(b) Filing. Filing is the receipt of pleadings and other submissions at OHA. Filers may call OHA to verify receipt. OHA's telephone number is (202) 401-8200.\n\n(1) OHA's address. OHA accepts filings: by e-mail at OHAFilings@sba.gov; by mail or delivery at Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416; and by facsimile at (202) 205-7059.\n\n(2) The date of filing is the date the submission is received at OHA. Any submission received at OHA after 5 p.m. eastern time is considered filed the next business day.\n\n(3) Exhibits. An exhibit, whether an original or a copy, must be authenticated or identified to be what it purports to be. Parties are referred to 28 U.S.C. 1746.\n\n(4) Copies. No extra copies of pleadings or other submissions need be filed. If a document is offered as an exhibit, a copy of the document will be accepted by the Judge unless—\n\n(i) a genuine question is raised as to whether it is a true and accurate copy; or\n\n(ii) it would be unfair, under the circumstances, to admit the copy instead of the original.\n\n(c) Service. Service means sending a copy of a pleading or other submission filed with OHA to another party.\n\n(1) Complete copies of all pleadings and other submissions filed with OHA must be served upon all other parties or, if represented, their attorneys, at their record addresses.\n\n(2) The date of service is as follows: for e-mail and facsimile, the date the copy is sent; for personal delivery, the date the copy is given to the party, its attorney, or the commercial delivery service (if one is used). For mail, date of service is postmark date; in absence of a legible postmark, there is a rebuttable presumption that the copy was mailed five days before the served party's receipt.\n\n(3) SBA address. The correct office(s) of SBA must be served, as required by the applicable program regulations, by other subparts of part 134, or by the instructions on the SBA determination being appealed. If the SBA office for service is not specified elsewhere, serve: Office of General Counsel, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416.\n\n(4) Confidential information. If a pleading or other submission contains proprietary or confidential information, that information may be redacted (deleted) from any copies served upon non-government parties. Counsel for those parties may access the redacted information only under the protective order procedure described in § 134.205.\n\n(d) Certificate of service. A certificate of service shows how, when, and to whom service was made. Each submission to OHA must include a certificate of service. The certificate should state: “I certify that on [date], I served the foregoing [type of submission] by [e-mail, mail, Express Mail, personal delivery, commercial delivery service, facsimile] upon the following”. List the name and address of each party served, and either the facsimile number or the e-mail address (if applicable). The individual serving the submission must sign the certificate and either print or type his or her name and title.\n\n[75 FR 47439, Aug. 6, 2010]",

    "content": "(a) The appeal file. The appeal file includes: all pleadings and other submissions; all admitted evidence; any recordings and transcripts of proceedings; the solicitation and amendments; in the case of an appeal of an SBA determination, the entire record on which that determination was based (i.e., the administrative record, protest file, area office file); and any orders and decisions that have been issued.\n\n(b) Confidential business and financial information. An appeal file usually contains confidential business and financial information pertaining to the party whose eligibility (as a small business, SDVO SBC, etc.) is at issue. A party may redact its own confidential business and financial information from the copies of its submissions it must serve on other non-government parties (usually protesters). A party served with redacted submissions must file and serve any objections to the redactions within two business days of its receipt of the submissions. The Judge then will rule on the objections and, if necessary, order the service of revised submissions.\n\n(c) Public access. Except for confidential business and financial information; source selection sensitive information; income tax returns; documents and information covered under § 120.1060 of this title; and other exempt information, the appeal file is available to the public pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552.\n\n(d) Party access. A party in a pending appeal may examine and copy the party's own submissions as well as any information in the appeal file that is not exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. Party access to the appeal file in a pending appeal does not require a FOIA request or a protective order.\n\n(e) Counsel's access under a protective order. On request, OHA will issue a protective order under which outside counsel for a non-government party in a pending appeal may be admitted, to examine and copy the appeal file (except for tax returns and privileged information). The protective order will set out the terms to which counsel must agree. The terms will restrict counsel's use of the protected information to the pending appeal and will prohibit any further disclosure. Violations of the terms of a protective order may result in sanctions to the party and referral of the attorney to bar disciplinary authorities. OHA's Web site contains detailed information on the protective order procedure.\n\n(f) Decisions. OHA decisions are normally published without redactions on OHA's Web site. A decision may contain confidential business and financial information where that information is either decisionally-significant or otherwise necessary for a comprehensible decision. Where no protective order is in place, a party may request a redacted public decision by contacting OHA. Where a protective order is in place, the Judge will usually issue the unredacted decision under the protective order and then a redacted version for public release.\n\n[75 FR 47440, Aug. 6, 2010, as amended at 85 FR 14784, Mar. 16, 2020]",

(1) Notice and order. Upon the filing of an appeal petition, OHA will issue a notice and order informing all known parties of the appeal petition and the deadline for filing and serving any responses to the appeal. The SBA response is due 45 days after the date the appeal petition is filed, unless a rule governing the particular type of appeal provides a different deadline.\n\n(2) SBA response. If SBA is the respondent, SBA need not admit or deny the allegations in the petition, but must set forth the relevant facts and the legal arguments in support of SBA's determination.\n\n(3) Administrative record. If SBA is to file and serve an authenticated copy of the administrative record (or protest file), the notice and order will provide further instructions.\n\n(4) Claim of privilege. If SBA asserts a claim of privilege over any portion of the administrative record, SBA must serve the petitioner a redacted version, accompanied by a “Vaughn Index” describing each withheld item and justifying each claim of privilege. SBA also must file an unredacted copy for in camera inspection by the Judge. The Judge will afford the petitioner an opportunity to object to the administrative record and to challenge any claim of privilege asserted by SBA.\n\n(c) If a petition or order to show cause is amended or if respondent is not properly served, the Judge will order the time to file an answer or response extended and will specify the date such answer or response is due. If respondent is not properly served with a petition appealing from an SBA determination, the Judge will issue an order directing that the petitioner serve respondent within a specified time and directing respondent to file and serve a response within 45 days after petitioner timely serves respondent in accordance with the order.\n\n(d) If the respondent fails to timely file and serve an answer or response, that failure will constitute a default. Following such a default, the Judge may prohibit the respondent from participating further in the case. If SBA, as respondent to a petition appealing from an SBA determination, fails to timely file and serve its response or the administrative record (where required), the Judge will issue an order directing SBA to file and serve the administrative record by a specified date.\n\n(e) Reply. A reply to a response is not permitted unless the Judge, upon motion or on his or her own initiative, orders a reply to be filed and served. A party moving for leave to reply should file and serve the proposed reply with its motion.\n\n[67 FR 47247, July 18, 2002, as amended at 75 FR 47440, Aug. 6, 2010]",

A stay while an interlocutory appeal is pending will be at the discretion of the Judge.\n\n[61 FR 2683, Jan. 29, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 47249, July 18, 2002]",

As long as the Agency's determination is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law, the Administrative Law Judge must uphold it on appeal.\n\n(1) The Administrative Law Judge must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\n\n(2) If the SBA's path of reasoning may reasonably be discerned, the Administrative Law Judge will uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity.\n\n(c) The administrative record. (1) The administrative record must contain all documents that are relevant to the determination on appeal before the Administrative Law Judge and upon which the SBA decision-maker, and those SBA officials that recommended either for or against the decision, relied. The administrative record, however, need not contain all documents pertaining to the petitioner. For example, the administrative record in a termination proceeding need not include the Participant's entire business plan file, documents pertaining to specific 8(a) contracts, or the firm's application for participation in the 8(a) BD program if they are unrelated to the termination action. The SBA may claim privilege as to certain materials.\n\n(2) The petitioner may object to the absence of a document, previously submitted to, or sent by, SBA, which the petitioner believes was erroneously omitted from the administrative record. The petitioner also may object to a claim of privilege made by the SBA. The petitioner's objections must be filed and served no later than 10 days of its receipt of the administrative record.\n\n(3) In the absence of any objection by the petitioner or a finding by the Judge pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section that the record is insufficiently complete to decide whether the determination was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, the administrative record submitted by SBA shall be deemed complete.\n\n(d) Where the Agency files its response to the appeal petition after the date specified in § 134.206, the Administrative Law Judge may decline to consider the response and base his or her decision solely on a review of the administrative record.\n\n(e) Remand. (1) The Administrative Law Judge may remand a case to the Director, Office of Business Development (or, in the case of a denial of a request for waiver under § 124.515 of this chapter, to the Administrator) for further consideration if he or she determines that, due to the absence in the written administrative record of the reasons upon which the determination was based, the administrative record is insufficiently complete to decide whether the determination is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. In the event of such a remand, the Judge will not require the SBA to supplement the administrative record other than to supply the reason or reasons for the determination and any documents submitted to, or considered by, SBA in connection with any reconsideration permitted by regulation that occurs during the remand period. After such a remand, in the event the Judge finds that the reasons upon which the determination is based are absent from any supplemented record, the Judge will find the SBA determination to be arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n\n(2) The Administrative Law Judge may also remand a case to the Director, Office of Business Development (or, in the case of a denial of a request for waiver under § 124.515 of this chapter, to the Administrator) for further consideration where it is clearly apparent from the record that SBA made an erroneous factual finding (e.g., SBA double counted an asset of an individual claiming disadvantaged status) or a mistake of law (e.g., SBA applied the wrong regulatory provision in evaluating the case).\n\n(3) The Administrative Law Judge may remand an eligibility, early graduation, or termination appeal to the Director, Office of Business Development, where the determination raises a new ground that was not in the initial SBA determination.\n\n(4) A remand under this section will be for a reasonable period.\n\n[63 FR 35766, June 30, 1998, as amended at 67 FR 47250, July 18, 2002; 74 FR 45754, Sept. 4, 2009; 75 FR 47443, Aug. 6, 2010; 81 FR 48595, July 25, 2016]",

In cases where the protest is based on service-connected disability, permanent and severe disability, or veteran status, the Judge will only consider a protest that presents specific allegations supporting the contention that the owner(s) cannot provide documentation from the VA, Department of Defense, or the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration to show that they meet the definition of veteran, service-disabled veteran, or service-disabled veteran with a permanent and severe disability.\n\n(b) Ownership and control. In cases where the protest is based on ownership and/or control, the Judge will consider a protest only if the protester presents credible evidence that the concern is not 51% owned and controlled by one or more veterans or service-disabled veterans.\n\n(c) Ostensible subcontractor. In cases where the protest is based on an allegation that the prime contractor appears unduly reliant on one or more, non-VOSB or non-SDVOSB subcontractors, or the non-VOSB or non-SDVOSB subcontractor is performing the primary and vital requirements of the contract, OHA will consider a protest only if the protester presents credible evidence of the alleged undue reliance or credible evidence that the primary and vital requirements will be performed by the subcontractor(s).\n\n(d) Joint ventures. A VOSB or SDVOSB joint venture may be protested regarding the status of the managing VOSB or SDVOSB joint venture partner or for failure to meet the requirements of § 128.402 of this chapter. If the joint venture is found to be ineligible solely based on failure to meet the requirements of that section, the joint venture will be ineligible for the contract at issue. The finding of ineligibility is limited to that contract and will not affect the underlying eligibility of the VOSB or SDVOSB joint venture partner.\n\n(e) Date for determining eligibility. (1) If the VOSB or SDVOSB status protest pertains to a procurement, the Judge will determine a protested concern's eligibility as a VOSB or SDVOSB as of the date of its initial offer or response which includes price for a competitively awarded VOSB/SDVOSB contract, order, or agreement, and as of the date of award for any sole source VOSB or SDVOSB award. For a protest challenging an ostensible subcontractor or a joint venture's compliance with the joint venture agreement requirements set forth in § 128.402(c), the Judge will determine eligibility as of the date of the final proposal revision for negotiated acquisitions or as of final bid for sealed bidding.\n\n(2) If the VOSB or SDVOSB status protest does not pertain to a procurement, the Judge will determine a protested concern's eligibility as a VOSB or SDVOSB as of the date the VOSB or SDVOSB status protest was filed.\n\n[87 FR 73425, Nov. 29, 2022, as amended at 89 FR 102510, Dec. 17, 2024]",

(1) The Secretary of the VA (or designee) or SBA may file a VOSB or SDVOSB status protest at any time.\n\n(2) The contracting officer, SBA, or VA may file a VOSB or SDVOSB status protest at any time after the apparent awardee has been identified or after bid opening, whichever applies.\n\n(3) For negotiated acquisitions, an interested party (see § 134.1002(b)) must submit its protest by close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the apparent successful offeror.\n\n(i) Except for an order or Blanket Purchase Agreement issued under a Federal Supply Schedule contract, for an order or Agreement that is set-aside for VOSBs or SDVOSBs under a multiple award contract that was not itself set aside or reserved for VOSBs or SDVOSBs, an interested party must submit its protest by close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the intended awardee of the order or Agreement.\n\n(ii) Where a contracting officer has required offerors for a specific order under a multiple award VOSB or SDVOSB contract to recertify their VOSB or SDVOSB status, an interested party must submit its protest by close of business on the fifth business day after notification by the contracting officer of the intended awardee of the order.\n\n(4) For sealed bid acquisitions, a protest from an interested party (see § 134.1002(b)) must be received by close of business on the fifth business day after bid opening. Where the identified low bidder is determined to be ineligible for award, a protest of any other identified low bidder must be received prior to the close of business on the 5th business day after the contracting officer has notified interested parties of the identity of that low bidder.\n\n(5) The rule for counting days is in § 134.202(d).\n\n(6) Any protest received after the time limit is untimely, unless it is from SBA, VA, or the contracting officer. An untimely protest will be dismissed.\n\n(b) Filing. (1) An interested party, other than SBA, VA, or the contracting officer, must deliver a VOSB or SDVOSB status protest to the contracting officer in person, by email, facsimile, by express delivery service, or by U.S. mail (postmarked within the applicable time period) to the contracting officer.\n\n(2) VA, SBA, or the contracting officer must submit a VOSB or SDVOSB status protest directly to OHA in accordance with the procedures in § 134.204. The protest should include in the referral letter the information set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.\n\n(3) SBA must submit a VOSB or SDVOSB status protest directly to OHA in accordance with the procedures in § 134.204.\n\n(c) Referral to OHA. The contracting officer must forward to OHA any VOSB or SDVOSB status protest received, notwithstanding whether the contracting officer believes it is premature, sufficiently specific, or timely. The contracting officer must send all VOSB or SDVOSB status protests, along with a referral letter, directly to OHA, addressed to Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 Third Street SW, Washington, DC 20416, or by email at OHAfilings@sba.gov, marked “Attn: VOSB Status Protest” or “Attn: SDVOSB Status Protest”. The referral letter must include information pertaining to the solicitation that may be necessary for OHA to determine timeliness and standing, including:\n\n(1) The solicitation number;\n\n(2) The name, address, telephone number, and email address of the contracting officer;\n\n(3) Whether the contract was a sole source or set-aside VOSB or SDVOSB procurement;\n\n(4) Whether the protester submitted an offer;\n\n(5) Whether the protested concern was the apparent successful offeror;\n\n(6) Whether the procurement was conducted using sealed bid or negotiated procedures;\n\n(7) The bid opening date, if applicable;\n\n(8) When the protested concern submitted its initial offer which included price;\n\n(9) When the protest was submitted to the contracting officer;\n\n(10) When the protester received notification of the apparent successful offeror, if applicable; and\n\n(11) Whether a contract has been awarded.",

    "content": "(a) Notice and order. If the Judge determines that the protest is timely, sufficiently specific, and based upon protestable allegations, the Judge will issue a notice and order, notifying the protester, the protested concern, the Director, Office of Government Contracting (D/GC), SBA Counsel, and, if applicable, the contracting officer of the date OHA received the protest, and order a due date for responses.\n\n(b) Dismissal of protest. If the Judge determines that the protest is premature, untimely, nonspecific, or is based on non-protestable allegations, the Judge will dismiss the protest and will send the contracting officer, D/GC, SBA's Associate General Counsel for Procurement Law, and the protester a notice of dismissal, citing the reason(s) for the dismissal. The dismissal is a final agency action.\n\n(c) Transmission of the case file. Upon receipt of a notice and order, the D/GC must deliver to OHA the entire case file relating to the protested concern's inclusion in the certification database. The notice and order will establish the timetable for transmitting the case file to OHA. The D/GC must certify and authenticate that the case file, to the best of his/her knowledge, is a true and correct copy of the case file.\n\n(d) Protective order. A protester seeking access to the SBA case file must file a timely request for a protective order under § 134.205. Except for good cause shown, a protester must request a protective order within five days of filing the protest. Even after issuance of a protective order, OHA will not disclose income tax returns or privileged information.\n\n(e) Supplemental allegations. If, after viewing documents in the SBA case file for the first time under a protective order, a protester wishes to supplement its protest with additional argument, the protester may do so. Any such supplement is due at OHA no later than 15 days from the date the protester receives or reviews the SBA case file.\n\n(f) Response—(1) Timing. The protested concern, the D/GC, the contracting officer, and any other interested party (see § 134.1002(b)) may respond to the protest and supplemental protest, if one is filed. The response is due no later than 15 days from the date the protest or supplemental protest was filed with OHA. The record closes the date the final response is due.\n\n(2) Service. The respondent must serve its response upon the protester or its counsel and upon each of the persons identified in the certificate of service attached to the notice and order or, if a protective order is issued, in accordance with the terms of the protective order.\n\n(3) Reply to a response. No reply to a response will be permitted unless the Judge directs otherwise.\n\n(g) Basis for decision. The decision will be based primarily on the case file and information provided by the protester, the protested concern, and any other parties. However, the Judge may investigate issues beyond those raised in the protest and may use other information or make requests for additional information to the protester, the protested concern, or SBA.\n\n(h) Award of contract. The contracting officer may award a contract before the Judge issues a decision only if the contracting officer determines that an award must be made to protect the public interest and notifies the Judge and D/GC in writing of such determination. Notwithstanding such a determination, the provisions of paragraph (j) of this section shall apply to the procurement in question.\n\n(i) Decision. OHA will serve a copy of the written decision on each party, or, if represented by counsel, on its counsel. The decision is considered the final agency action, and it becomes effective upon issuance.\n\n(j) Effect of decision. (1) A contracting officer may award a contract to a protested concern after the Judge has determined either that the protested concern is eligible for inclusion in SBA's certification database or has dismissed all protests against it.\n\n(2) A contracting officer shall not award a contract to a protested concern that the Judge has determined is not an eligible VOSB or SDVOSB. If the contract has already been awarded, the contracting officer shall terminate the contract, unless the contracting officer has made a written determination that termination is not in the best interests of the Government. However, the contracting officer shall not exercise any options or award further task or delivery orders.\n\n(3) The contracting officer must update the Federal Procurement Data System (or successor system) and other procurement reporting databases to reflect the Judge's decision.\n\n(4) If the Judge finds the protested concern is not an eligible VOSB or SDVOSB, the D/GC must immediately remove the protested concern from the certification database.\n\n(5) A concern found to be ineligible may not submit an offer on a future VOSB or SDVOSB procurement until the protested concern reapplies to the Veteran Small Business Certification Program and has been designated by SBA as a VOSB or SDVOSB into the certification database.\n\n[87 FR 73425, Nov. 29, 2022, as amended at 88 FR 42593, July 3, 2023]",

    "content": "(a) The rules of practice in this subpart apply to appeals to OHA from certain final SBA loan review decisions under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) as described in paragraph (b) of this section, and to any other PPP matter referred to OHA by the Administrator of SBA. The PPP was established as a temporary program under section 1102 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) (Pub. L. 116-136), as amended. PPP loans include first draw PPP loans made under Section 7(a)(36) of the Small Business Act and second draw PPP loans made under Section 7(a)(37) of the Small Business Act.\n\n(b) A final SBA loan review decision that is appealable under this subpart is an official written decision by SBA, after SBA completes a review of a PPP loan, that finds a borrower:\n\n(1) Was ineligible for a PPP loan;\n\n(2) Was ineligible for the PPP loan amount received or used the PPP loan proceeds for unauthorized uses;\n\n(3) Is ineligible for PPP loan forgiveness in the amount determined by the lender in its full approval or partial approval decision issued to SBA; and/or\n\n(4) Is ineligible for PPP loan forgiveness in any amount when the lender has issued a full denial decision to SBA.\n\n(c) A borrower cannot directly file an appeal of a decision made by a lender concerning a PPP loan with OHA.\n\n(d) An appeal to OHA is an administrative remedy that must be exhausted before judicial review of a final SBA loan review decision may be sought in a Federal district court.\n\n(e) Any determination by SBA's Office of Inspector General concerning a PPP loan is not appealable to OHA.\n\n(f) This subpart does not create any right to appeal any SBA decision on any 7(a) loans (see part 120 of this chapter) other than PPP loans.\n\n(g) The Rules of Practice for Appeals From Size Determinations and NAICS Code Designations in subpart C of this part do not apply to appeals of final SBA loan review decisions or to the PPP.\n\n(h) In addition to the provisions in subpart B of this part specifically referenced in this subpart, the following regulations from subpart B of this part also apply to this subpart: §§ 134.207 (Amendments and supplemental pleadings); 134.208 (Representation in cases before OHA); 134.209 (Requirement of signature); 134.211 (Motions); 134.212 (Summary judgment); 134.217 (Settlement); 134.218 (Judges); 134.219 (Sanctions); and 134.220 (Prohibition on ex parte communications). Other provisions from subpart B of this part that are not specifically referenced in this subpart do not apply to this subpart.",

An appellant is required to use the OHA Case Portal to file and manage their appeal.\n\n(b) Appellant must provide their lender with a copy of the timely appeal petition upon filing in order for the lender to extend the deferment period of the PPP loan until a final decision is issued under § 134.1211.\n\n(c)(1) Do not count the day the time period begins, but do count the last day of the time period.\n\n(2) If the last day is Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday, the time period ends on the next business day.\n\nExample: On a Thursday, a borrower receives a final SBA loan review decision. The time period begins on Thursday, so the first day to count is Friday.

The decision will be served upon appellant and SBA utilizing the OHA Case Portal.\n\n(b) Initial decision. The Judge's decision on the appeal is an initial decision. However, unless a request for reconsideration is filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or the SBA Administrator, solely within the Administrator's discretion, decides to review or reverse the initial decision pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, an initial decision shall become the final decision of SBA 30 calendar days after its service. The discretionary authority of the Administrator does not create any additional rights of appeal on the part of an appellant not otherwise specified in SBA regulations in this chapter.

The request for reconsideration must clearly show an error of fact or law material to the decision. SBA does not have to have filed a response to the borrower's appeal petition to request reconsideration of the initial decision of the Judge.\n\n(2) The Judge may also reconsider a decision on his or her own initiative within 20 calendar days after service of the Judge's decision.\n\n(3) A reconsidered initial OHA decision becomes the final decision of SBA 30 calendar days after its service unless the SBA Administrator, solely within the Administrator's discretion, decides to review or reverse the reconsidered initial OHA decision under paragraph (d) of this section. The discretionary authority of the Administrator does not create any additional rights of appeal on the part of an appellant not otherwise specified in SBA regulations in this chapter.\n\n(d) Administrator review. Within 30 calendar days after the service of an initial OHA decision or a reconsidered initial OHA decision of a Judge, the SBA Administrator, solely within the Administrator's discretion, may elect to review and/or reverse an initial OHA decision or a reconsidered initial OHA decision. In the event that the Administrator elects to review and/or reverse an initial OHA decision and a timely request for reconsideration of a Judge's initial decision is also filed by an appellant pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator will consider such request for reconsideration. The Administrator's decision will become the final decision of the SBA upon issuance.\n\n(e) Precedent. Neither initial nor final decisions rendered by OHA under this subpart are precedential.\n\n(f) Publication. Final decisions are normally published without redactions on OHA's website. PPP decisions will likely contain confidential business and financial information and/or personally identifiable information. Therefore, OHA, within its full discretion, may publish final decisions issued under this section with any necessary redactions.\n\n(g) Appeal to Federal district court. Final decisions may be appealed to the appropriate Federal district court only.",

The Agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—\n\n(1) Necessarily require the Agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; or\n\n(2) Require the Agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where Agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 136.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Administrator or Deputy Administrator after considering all Agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. The Administrator or Deputy Administrator's decision shall be made within 30 days of the initial decision by Agency personnel that an action would result in such an alteration or burdens. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would, nevertheless, ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.\n\n(b) Methods. The Agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aids to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The Agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The Agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the Agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.\n\n(c) Time period for compliance. The Agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by September 13, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by July 15, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.\n\n(d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the Agency shall develop, by January 16, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The Agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum:\n\n(1) Identify physical obstacles in the Agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;\n\n(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;\n\n(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and\n\n(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.",

If an informal resolution of the complaint is not reached, the AA/EEOCCR shall, within 180 days of receipt of the complete complaint, notify the complainant, the respondent and the Director, Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Compliance (OEEOC), of the results of the investigation in a letter sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and containing—\n\n(1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;\n\n(2) A description of a remedy for each violation found;\n\n(3) A notice of the right of the complainant and respondent to appeal to the Director, OEEOC; and\n\n(4) A notice of the right of the complainant and respondent to request a hearing.\n\nThe letter of findings becomes the final Agency decision if neither party files an appeal within the time prescribed in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. The AA/EEOCCR shall certify that the letter of findings is the final Agency decision on the complaint at the expiration of that time.\n\n(h) Filing an appeal. (1) Any notice of appeal to the AA/EEOCCR, with or without a request for hearing, shall be filed by the complainant or the respondent in writing with the AA/EEOCCR within 30 days of receipt from him or her of the letter required by paragraph (g) of this section. The notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of service attesting that the party has served a copy of his or her notice of appeal on all other parties to the proceeding. The AA/EEOCCR may extend this time limit for good cause shown pursuant to the procedure in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.\n\n(2) If a timely notice of appeal without a request for hearing is filed, any other party may file a written request for hearing within the time limit specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section or within 10 days of his or her receipt of such notice of appeal, whichever is later.\n\n(3) A party may appeal to the AA/EEOCCR from a decision of the AA/EEOCCR that an appeal is untimely. This appeal shall be filed with the AA/EEOCCR within 15 days of receipt of the decision from the AA/EEOCCR.\n\n(4) Any request for hearing will be construed as a request for an oral hearing. The complainant's failure to file a timely request for a hearing in accordance with this part shall constitute waiver of the right to a hearing, but shall not preclude his or her submitting written information and argument to the AA/EEOCCR in connection with his or her notice of appeal.\n\n(i) Acceptance of appeal. The AA/EEOCCR shall accept and process any timely filed appeal.\n\n(1) If a notice of appeal is filed but no party requests a hearing, the AA/EEOCCR shall promptly transmit the complaint file, the letter of findings and the notice of appeal to the AA/EEOCCR.\n\n(2) If a notice of appeal if filed and a party makes a timely request for a hearing, the AA/EEOCCR will transmit the notice of appeal, the request for hearing and the investigative file to the Office of Hearings and Appeals which office will assign the case to an administrative judge who will conduct a hearing in accordance with the procedures contained in 13 CFR part 134.\n\n(j) Decision. (1) Where no request for a hearing is made, the AA/EEOCCR shall make the final Agency decision based on the contents of the complaint file, the letter of findings, the notice of appeal, and any responses to the notice of appeal filed by other parties. The decision shall be made within 60 days of receipt of the appeal or any response to the notice of appeal, whichever is applicable. If the AA/EEOCCR, determines that he or she needs additional information from any party, he or she shall request the information and provide the other party or parties an opportunity to respond to that information. The AA/EEOCCR shall have 60 days from receipt of the additional information or responses to such additional information, whichever is later, to make the decision. The AA/EEOCCR shall transmit his or her decision in writing to the parties. The decision shall set forth the findings, remedial actions, and reasons for the decision.\n\n(2) Where a request for a hearing has been made, the administrative judge shall issue an initial decision, in writing, based on the hearing record, composed of the proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and remedies, to the parties and to the AA/EEOCCR within 30 days after receipt of the hearing transcripts, or within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing if no transcript is made. This time limit may be extended with the permission of the AA/EEOCCR. The decision of the administrative judge shall be deemed to be the final decision of the Agency after 30 days, unless a party files a petition for review with the AA/EEOCCR, pursuant to 13 CFR 134.228(a) or the AA/EEOCCR issues an order stating his or her decision to review the initial decision, pursuant to 13 CFR 134.228(a). See 13 CFR 134.227(b).\n\n(3) Where a petition for review is filed or a review is ordered by the AA/EEOCCR the AA/EEOCCR shall make the final decision of the Agency based on information in the complaint file, the letter of findings, the hearing record, the initial decision, the petition for review, and any responses to the petition or order. The decision shall be made within 60 days of receipt of the petition for review, the order, or any responses to such petition or order, whichever is later. If the AA/EEOCCR determines that he or she needs additional information from any party, he or she shall request the information and provide the other party or parties an opportunity to respond to that information. The AA/EEOCCR shall have 60 days from receipt of the additional information or responses to such additional information, whichever is later, to make the decision. The AA/EEOCCR shall transmit his or her decision by letter to the parties. The decision shall set forth the findings, recommended remedial actions, and reasons for the decision. The decision shall adopt, reject, or modify the initial decision of the administrative judge. If the decision is to reject or modify the initial decision, the decision letter shall set forth in detail the specific reasons for the rejection or modification.\n\n(4) Any respondent required to take action under the terms of the decision of the Agency shall do so promptly. The AA/EEOCCR may require periodic compliance reports specifying:\n\n(i) The manner in which compliance with the provisions of the decision has been achieved;\n\n(ii) The reasons any action required by the final decision has not been taken; and\n\n(iii) The steps being taken to ensure full compliance.\n\n(k) The time limit cited in paragraph (f) of this section may be extended with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.\n\n(l) The Agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for making the final determination may not be delegated to another agency.\n\n[53 FR 19760, May 31, 1988, as amended at 61 FR 2691, Jan. 29, 1996; 72 FR 50042, Aug. 30, 2007]",

    "content": "(a) A debt means an amount owed to the United States from loans made or guaranteed by the United States, and from fees, leases, rents, royalties, services, sales of real or personal property, overpayments, fines, penalties, damages, interest, forfeitures, or any other source. You are a debtor if you owe an amount to the United States from any of these sources.\n\n(b) SBA may collect past-due debts through offset by using any of three procedures: administrative offset, salary offset, or IRS tax refund offset. A past-due debt is one which has been reduced to judgment, has been accelerated, or has been due for at least 90 days.\n\n(1) Administrative offset. SBA may withhold money it owes to the debtor in order to satisfy the debt. This procedure is an “administrative offset” and is authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3716.\n\n(2) Salary offset. If the debtor is a federal employee (a civilian employee as defined by 5 U.S.C. 2105, an employee of the U.S. Postal Service or Postal Rate Commission, or a member of the Uniformed Services or Reserve of the Uniformed Services), SBA may deduct payments owed to SBA or another federal agency from the debtor's paycheck. This procedure is a “salary offset” and is authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5514.\n\n(i) Any amount deducted from salary in any one pay period will not exceed 15 percent of a debtor's disposable pay, unless the debtor agrees in writing to a greater percentage.\n\n(ii) SBA also may collect against travel advances, training expenses, disallowed payments, retirement benefits, or any other amount due the employee, including lump-sum payments.\n\n(iii) If an employee has terminated employment after salary offset has been initiated, there are no limitations on the amount that can be withheld or offset.\n\n(3) IRS tax refund offset. SBA may request that IRS reduce a debtor's tax refund by the amount of the debt, as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3720A. Where available, administrative and salary offsets must be used before collection is attempted through income tax offset. SBA may refer a debt to the IRS for a tax refund offset and take additional action against the debtor to collect the debt at the same time or in sequence. When SBA makes simultaneous or sequential referrals (within six months of the initial notice), only one review pursuant to the rules in this part and the statutes authorizing them is required.",

    "content": "(a) SBA must write to you and tell you that it proposes to collect the debt by reducing your federal paycheck, withholding money the Government owes you, and/or reducing your tax refund.\n\n(b) In its written notice to you, SBA must tell you the nature and amount of the debt; that SBA will begin procedures to collect the debt through reduction of your federal paycheck, administrative offset, or reduction of your tax refund; that you have an opportunity to inspect and copy Government records relating to the debt at your expense; and that, before collection begins, you have an opportunity to agree with SBA on a schedule for repayment of your debt.\n\n(c) SBA also must tell you that unless you respond within 60 days from the date of the notice, it will disclose to consumer reporting agencies (also known as credit bureaus or credit agencies) that you are responsible for the debt and the specific information it intends to disclose in order to establish your identity. The amount, status, history of the debt, and agency program under which it arose also will be disclosed.\n\n(d) If you respond to SBA within 60 days from the date of the notice, SBA will not disclose the information to consumer reporting agencies until it considers your response and determines that you owe a past-due, legally enforceable debt.\n\n(e) Within 60 days of the notice you may present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due or not legally enforceable.\n\n(1) Where a salary offset or administrative offset is proposed, you will have the opportunity to present your evidence to SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (“OHA”). The rules in part 134 of this title govern the procedural rights to which you are entitled. In order to have a hearing before OHA, you must request a hearing within 15 days of receipt of the written notice described in this section. An OHA judge will issue a decision within 60 days of the date you filed your petition/request for a review or hearing with OHA, unless you were granted additional time within which to file your request for review.\n\n(2) Where an income tax refund offset is proposed, you will have the opportunity to request a review and present your evidence to the appropriate SBA Commercial Loan Servicing Center at the address provided in the notice.\n\n(f) SBA must consider any evidence you present and must first decide that a debt is past due and legally enforceable. A debt is legally enforceable if there is any forum, including a State or Federal Court or administrative agency, in which SBA's claim would not be barred on the date of offset. Non-judgment debts are enforceable for ten years; judgment debts are enforceable beyond ten years. You will be notified of SBA's decision at least 30 days before any offset deduction is made. You also will be notified of the amount, frequency, proposed beginning date, and duration of the deductions, as well as any obligation to pay interest, penalties, and administrative costs.\n\n(g) If there is any substantial change in the status or amount of your debt, SBA will promptly report that change to each consumer reporting agency it originally contacted.\n\n(h) SBA will obtain satisfactory assurances from each consumer reporting agency that the consumer reporting agency has complied with all federal laws relating to provision of consumer credit information.\n\n(i) If your debt is being repaid by reduction of your income tax refund and you make any additional payments to SBA, SBA will notify the IRS of these payments and your new balance within 10 business days of receiving your payment.\n\n(j) When the debt of a federal employee is reduced to court judgment, the employee is not entitled to further review by SBA, but is only entitled to notice of a proposed salary offset resulting from the judgment. The amount deducted may not exceed 15% of disposable pay, except when the deduction of a greater amount is necessary to completely collect the debt within the employee's remaining period of employment.\n\n(k) When another federal agency asks SBA to offset a debt for it, SBA will not initiate the requested offset until it has received from the creditor agency a written certification that the debtor owes a debt, its amount, and that the provisions of all applicable statutes and regulations have been complied with fully.\n\n(l) SBA may make an offset prior to completion of the procedures described in this part, if:\n\n(1) Failure to make an offset would substantially prejudice the government's ability to collect the debt; and\n\n(2) The time before the payment would otherwise be made to you does not reasonably permit the completion of the procedures.\n\n(3) Such prior offset then must be followed by the completion of the procedures described in this part.\n\n(m) Where an IRS tax refund offset is sought, SBA must follow the Department of the Treasury's regulations governing offset of a past-due, legally enforceable debt against tax overpayment.",

    "content": "(a) General. SBA may order your employer to pay SBA a portion of your disposable pay to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt you owe to the United States. This process is called “administrative wage garnishment” and is authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3720D.\n\n(b) Scope. (1) This section provides procedures for SBA to collect delinquent non-tax debts through administrative wage garnishment.\n\n(2) This section applies despite any State law.\n\n(3) Nothing in this section prevents SBA from settling for less than the full amount of a debt. See, for example, the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS), 31 CFR parts 900-904.\n\n(4) SBA's receipt of payments under this section does not prevent SBA from pursuing other debt collection remedies. SBA may pursue debt collection remedies separately or together with administrative wage garnishment.\n\n(5) This section does not apply to the collection of delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States from the wages of Federal employees. Federal pay is subject to the Federal salary offset procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and other laws, including subpart B of this part.\n\n(6) Nothing in this section requires SBA to duplicate notices or administrative proceedings required by contract, other laws, or regulations.\n\n(c) Definitions. In this section the following definitions apply:\n\nAgency means the SBA or any entity, public or private, that pursues recovery of the debt on SBA's behalf.\n\nBusiness day means Monday through Friday excluding Federal legal holidays.\n\nDay means calendar day. For purposes of computation, the last day of the period will be included unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a Federal legal holiday.\n\nDebt or claim means any amount of money, funds or property that has been determined by an appropriate official of the Federal Government to be owed to the United States by an individual, including debt administered by a third party as an agent for the Federal Government. Debt also includes accrued interest, administrative costs incurred in collection efforts by SBA or a lender participating in an SBA loan program, and penalties imposed pursuant to law or contract.\n\nDebtor or you means an individual who owes a delinquent non-tax debt to the United States.\n\nDelinquent non-tax debt means any debt not related to an obligation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that has not been paid by the date specified in SBA's initial written demand for payment, or applicable agreement, unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been made. For purposes of this section, the terms “debt” and “claim” are synonymous and refer to delinquent non-tax debt.\n\nDisposable pay means that part of the debtor's compensation (including, but not limited to, salary, bonuses, commissions, and vacation pay) from an employer remaining after the deduction of health insurance premiums and any amounts required by law to be withheld. For purposes of this section, “amounts required by law to be withheld” include amounts for deductions such as social security taxes and withholding taxes, but do not include any amount withheld pursuant to a court order.\n\nEmployer means a person or entity that employs the services of others and that pays their wages or salaries. The term employer includes, but is not limited to, State and local Governments, but does not include an agency of the Federal Government.\n\nEvidence of service means information retained by the Agency indicating the nature of the document to which it pertains, the date of mailing of the document, and to whom the document is being sent. Evidence of service may be retained electronically so long as the manner of retention is sufficient for evidentiary purposes.\n\nGarnishment means the process of withholding amounts from an employee's disposable pay and the paying of those amounts to a creditor in satisfaction of a withholding order.\n\nWithholding order means any order for withholding or garnishment of pay issued by an agency, or judicial or administrative body. For purposes of this section, the terms “wage garnishment order” and “garnishment order” have the same meaning as “withholding order.”\n\n(d) When may the Agency initiate administrative wage garnishment proceedings? Whenever the Agency determines you owe a delinquent non-tax debt, the Agency may initiate administrative wage garnishment proceedings to withhold a portion of your wages to satisfy the debt.\n\n(e) Notice Requirements. (1) The Agency will send a written notice by first-class mail to your last known address at least 30 days before initiating garnishment. This pre-garnishment notice will inform you of:\n\n(i) The type and amount of the debt;\n\n(ii) The Agency's intent to collect the debt by making deductions from your pay until the debt is paid in full;\n\n(iii) An explanation of your rights, including those listed below, and the timeframe within which you may exercise your rights.\n\n(2) You have the right to:\n\n(i) Inspect and copy non-privileged SBA records related to the debt;\n\n(ii) Enter into a written repayment agreement with SBA under terms agreeable to SBA; and\n\n(iii) Have a hearing before an SBA hearing official in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section concerning the existence or the amount of the debt or the terms of the proposed repayment schedule under the garnishment order. However, you are not entitled to a hearing concerning the terms of the proposed repayment schedule if those terms have been established by written agreement under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.\n\n(3) The Agency will retain evidence of service showing when the Agency mailed the pre-garnishment notice.\n\n(f) What type of hearing must SBA give me?—(1) Procedural rules. Procedural rules for the conduct of administrative wage garnishment hearings are established in this section.\n\n(2) Request for hearing. You will be provided with a hearing, if you request one in writing disputing either the existence or amount of the debt or the terms of the repayment schedule (except a repayment schedule you and SBA agreed to in writing).\n\n(3) Type of hearing or review. (i) You will have the right to an oral hearing only if the Hearing Official determines that the issues in dispute cannot be resolved solely by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the Hearing Official finds that the validity of the claim turns on the issue of credibility or veracity.\n\n(ii) If the Hearing Official determines an oral hearing is needed, he or she will set the time and location. You may choose whether the oral hearing is conducted in person or by telephone. You must pay all travel expenses for yourself and your witnesses to attend an in-person hearing. SBA will pay telephone charges for telephone hearings.\n\n(iii) If no oral hearing is needed, the Hearing Official will accord you a “paper hearing,” that is, the Hearing Official will decide the issues in dispute based upon a review of the written record. The Hearing Official will set a reasonable deadline for the submission of evidence.\n\n(4) Effect of timely request for hearing. Subject to paragraph (f)(13) of this section (failure to appear), if the Hearing Official determines your written request for a hearing was received by the Hearing Official by the 15th business day after the Agency mailed the pre-garnishment notice, the Agency will not issue a garnishment order before the Hearing Official renders a decision.\n\n(5) Untimely request for hearing. If the Hearing Official determines your written request for a hearing was not received by the Hearing Official by the 15th business day after the Agency mailed the pre-garnishment notice, the Agency will provide a hearing to you. However, the Agency may proceed with the issuance of a garnishment order and acceptance of payments unless the Hearing Official determines that the delay in filing the request was caused by factors over which you had no control, or that information received justifies a delay or cancellation of the garnishment order.\n\n(6) Hearing official. A hearing official may be any qualified individual designated in the pre-garnishment notice.\n\n(7) Procedure. After you request a hearing, the Hearing Official will decide what type of hearing to hold and will notify you and the SBA of:\n\n(i) The date and time of a telephonic hearing;\n\n(ii) The date, time, and location of an in-person oral hearing; or\n\n(iii) The deadline for the submission of evidence for a written hearing.\n\n(8) Burden of proof. (i) The SBA will have the burden of going forward to prove the existence or amount of the debt.\n\n(ii) Thereafter, if you dispute the existence or amount of the debt, you must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is incorrect. In addition, you may present evidence that the terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause you a financial hardship, or that collection of the debt may not be pursued due to operation of law.\n\n(9) Record. The Hearing Official must maintain a summary record of any hearing provided under this section. A hearing is not required to be a formal evidentiary-type hearing; however, witnesses who testify in oral hearings will do so under oath or affirmation.\n\n(10) Date of decision. The Hearing Official must render a written decision within 60 days of the date on which your request for a hearing was received by OHA. If the Hearing Official's decision is not rendered within that time, and the Agency had previously issued a garnishment order, the Agency must suspend garnishment beginning on the 61st day. This suspension must continue until the Hearing Official renders a decision.\n\n(11) Content of decision. The written decision shall include:\n\n(i) A summary of the facts presented;\n\n(ii) The Hearing Official's findings, analysis and conclusions; and\n\n(iii) The terms of any repayment schedule, if applicable.\n\n(12) Final agency action. The decision of the hearing official is the final agency decision for the purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.).\n\n(13) Failure to appear. In the absence of good cause shown, a debtor who fails to appear at an oral hearing will be deemed as not having timely filed a request for a hearing.\n\n(g) Garnishment order. (1) Unless the Agency receives an adverse decision from the Hearing Official or information it believes justifies delaying or canceling garnishment, the Agency will send the garnishment order to your employer by first-class mail, within the following time frames:\n\n(i) If you did not make a timely request for a pre-garnishment hearing, within 30 days following the 15th business day after the Agency mailed the pre-garnishment notice;\n\n(ii) If you did make a timely request for a pre-garnishment hearing, within 30 days after the final agency decision to proceed with garnishment; or,\n\n(iii) As soon as reasonably possible thereafter.\n\n(2) The garnishment order will be in a form prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and will contain the signature of, or the image of the signature of, SBA's Administrator or his/her delegatee. The garnishment order will contain only the information necessary for compliance, including your name, address, and social security number, the instructions for garnishing your pay, and the address for sending payments.\n\n(3) The Agency will retain evidence of service showing when it mailed the garnishment order.\n\n(h) Certification by employer. Along with the garnishment order, the Agency will send your employer a certification, in a form determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. Your employer must complete and return this certification to us within the time stated in the certification instructions. The certification will include information about your employment status and the amount of your disposable pay available for garnishment.\n\n(i) Amounts withheld. (1) Your employer must deduct the garnishment amount from your disposable pay during each pay period.\n\n(2) Except as shown in paragraphs (i)(3) and (i)(4) of this section, the amount of garnishment will be the lesser of:\n\n(i) The amount stated on the garnishment order, not to exceed 15% of your disposable pay; or,\n\n(ii) The amount in 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) (Restriction on Garnishment). This is the amount by which your disposable pay exceeds an amount equivalent to thirty times the minimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.\n\n(3) If your pay is subject to other garnishment orders, the following applies:\n\n(i) Unless otherwise provided by Federal law, the Agency garnishment orders must be paid in the amounts in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, and will have priority over other garnishment orders issued later. However, withholding orders for family support have priority over the Agency garnishment orders.\n\n(ii) If amounts are being withheld from your pay because of a garnishment order issued before the Agency's garnishment order, or because of a garnishment order for family support issued at any time, the earlier or family support order will have priority, and the amount withheld because of the Agency garnishment order will be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount calculated under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, or\n\n(B) An amount equal to 25% of your disposable pay minus the amount withheld under the garnishment order(s) with priority.\n\n(iii) If you owe more than one delinquent non-tax debt, the Agency may issue multiple garnishment orders if the amount withheld from your pay does not exceed the amount in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.\n\n(4) You may give written consent for the Agency to garnish from your pay an amount greater than that in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section.\n\n(5) Your employer must promptly pay to the Agency all amounts withheld under a withholding order.\n\n(6) Your employer is not required to change normal pay cycles to comply with the garnishment order.\n\n(7) No assignment or allotment of your earnings that you have requested may interfere with or prohibit execution of the Agency 's garnishment order. The one exception to this rule is that you may assign or allot earnings because of a family support judgment or order.\n\n(8) The garnishment order will state a reasonable time period within which your employer must begin wage garnishment. Your employer must withhold the designated amount from your wages each pay period until the Agency notifies your employer to stop wage garnishment.\n\n(j) Exclusions from garnishment. The Agency may not garnish your wages if the Agency knows you have been involuntarily unemployed at any time during the last 12 months. You are responsible for informing the Agency of the facts and circumstances of your unemployment.\n\n(k) Financial hardship. (1) If your wages are subject to a garnishment order issued by the Agency, you may, at any time, request a review of the amount being withheld from your wages based on a material change in circumstances that causes you financial hardship, such as disability, divorce, or catastrophic illness. You may send your request to the Director of SBA's loan servicing center in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\n(2) If you request review under paragraph (k)(1) of this section, you must specifically state why the current amount of garnishment causes you financial hardship and you must send documentation supporting your claim.\n\n(3) If the Agency finds financial hardship, the Agency will decide how much and how long to reduce the amount garnished from your pay. The Agency will notify your employer of any reductions.\n\n(l) Ending garnishment. (1) After the Agency has recovered the amount you owe, including interest, penalties, and administrative costs consistent with the FCCS, the Agency will send a notice to your employer to stop wage garnishment with a copy to you.\n\n(2) The Agency will review your account to ensure that garnishment has stopped if you have paid your debt in full.\n\n(m) Prohibited actions. No employer may fire, refuse to employ, or take disciplinary action against you because of a withholding order issued by the Agency.\n\n(n) Refunds. (1) The Agency must promptly refund any amount collected by administrative wage garnishment if either—\n\n(i) A Judge, after a hearing held under paragraph (f) of this section, determines you do not owe a debt to the United States; or\n\n(ii) The Agency determines that your employer continued submitting to the Agency withheld wages after you had paid your debt in full.\n\n(2) Refunds of amounts collected will not earn interest unless required by federal law or contract.\n\n(o) Right of action. The Agency may sue your employer for any amount that the employer fails to withhold from wages owed and payable to you in accordance with paragraphs (g) and (i) of this section. However, the Agency may not file such a suit until the collection action involving you has ended unless earlier filing is necessary to avoid expiration of any applicable statute of limitations period. For purposes of this section, the collection action involving you ends when the Agency stops the collection action in accordance with the FCCS or other applicable standards. In any event, the collection action involving you will be deemed ended if the Agency has not received any payments from you to satisfy your debt, in whole or in part, for a period of one (1) year.\n\n[70 FR 17587, Apr. 7, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 63628, Oct. 27, 2008]",

(1) Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph (a), for a Project to be eligible for Investment Assistance under parts 305 or 307 of this chapter, the Project must be located in a Region that, on the date EDA receives an application for Investment Assistance, is subject to one or more of the following economic distress criteria:\n\n(i) An unemployment rate that is, for the most recent 24-month period for which data are available, at least one percentage point greater than the national average unemployment rate;\n\n(ii) Per capita income that is, for the most recent period for which data are available, 80 percent or less of the national average per capita income; or\n\n(iii) A Special Need, as determined by EDA.\n\n(2) A Project located within an Economic Development District, which is located in a Region that does not meet the economic distress criteria described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, also is eligible for Investment Assistance under parts 305 or 307 of this chapter if EDA determines that the Project will be of “substantial direct benefit” to a geographic area within the District that meets the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For this purpose, a Project provides a “substantial direct benefit” if it provides significant employment opportunities for unemployed, underemployed or low-income residents of the geographic area within the District.\n\n(3) A Project located in a geographic area of poverty or high unemployment that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but which is located in a Region that overall does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, is eligible for Investment Assistance under parts 305 or 307 of this chapter without regard to political or other subdivisions or boundaries.\n\n(4) Data requirements to demonstrate economic distress levels. EDA will determine the economic distress levels pursuant to this subsection at the time EDA receives an application for Investment Assistance as follows:\n\n(i) For economic distress levels based upon per capita income requirements, EDA will base its determination upon the most recent American Community Survey (“ACS”) published by the U.S. Census Bureau. For economic distress levels based upon the unemployment rate, EDA will base its determination upon the most recent data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”), within the U.S. Department of Labor. For eligibility based upon either per capita income requirements or the unemployment rate, when the ACS or BLS data, as applicable, are not the most recent Federal data available, EDA will base its decision upon the most recent Federal data from other sources (including data available from the Census Bureau and the Bureaus of Economic Analysis, Labor Statistics, Indian Affairs, or any other Federal source determined by EDA to be appropriate). If no Federal data are available, an Eligible Applicant must submit to EDA the most recent data available from the State. The required data must be for the Region where the Project will be located (paragraph (a)(1) of this section), the geographic area where substantial direct Project benefits will occur (paragraph (a)(2) of this section), or the geographic area of poverty or high unemployment (paragraph (a)(3) of this section), as applicable.\n\n(ii) For economic distress based upon a Special Need, EDA will conduct the independent analysis it deems necessary under the facts and circumstances of a given case. Eligible Applicants are encouraged to submit reliable data substantiating their claim of a Special Need.\n\n(b) Part 303 (Planning Investments) and part 306 (Training, Research and Technical Assistance Investments). There are no minimum economic distress level requirements for Investment Assistance awarded to Projects under parts 303 or 306 of this chapter.\n\n(c) Part 304 (Economic Development Districts). For EDA to designate a Region as an Economic Development District under part 304 of this chapter, such Region must:\n\n(1) Contain at least one geographic area that fulfills the economic distress criteria set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and is identified in an approved CEDS; and\n\n(2) Meet the Regional eligibility requirements set forth in § 304.1 of this chapter.\n\n(d) EDA reserves the right to reject any documentation of Project eligibility that it determines is inaccurate or otherwise unreliable.\n\n[71 FR 56675, Sept. 27, 2006, as amended at 73 FR 62865, Oct. 22, 2008; 79 FR 76124, Dec. 19, 2014]",

Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section, the maximum EDA Investment Rate for all Projects shall be determined in accordance with Table 1 in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. The maximum EDA Investment Rate shall not exceed the sum of 50 percent, plus up to an additional 30 percent based on the relative needs of the Region in which the Project is located, as determined by EDA.\n\n(i)(A) Relative needs. In determining the relative needs of the Region in which the Project is located, EDA will prioritize allocations of its Investment Assistance to ensure that the level of economic distress of a Region, rather than a preference for a specific geographic area or a specific type of economic distress, is the primary factor in allocating its Investment Assistance. In making this determination, EDA will take into consideration the following measures of economic distress:\n\n(1) The severity of the unemployment rate and the duration of the unemployment in the Region;\n\n(2) The per capita income levels and the extent of underemployment in the Region;\n\n(3) The outmigration of population and the extent to which such outmigration is causing economic injury in the Region; and\n\n(4) Such other factors as EDA deems relevant in determining the relative needs of the Region in which the Project is located.\n\n(B) A Project is eligible for the maximum allowable Investment Rate as determined by EDA between the time EDA receives the application for Investment Assistance and the time that EDA awards Investment Assistance to the Project; however, the burden is on the Eligible Applicant to establish the relative needs of the Region in which the Project is located.\n\n(ii) Table 1. Table 1 of this paragraph sets forth the maximum allowable Investment Rate for Projects located in Regions subject to certain levels of economic distress. In cases where Table 1 produces divergent results (i.e., where Table 1 produces more than one maximum allowable Investment Rate based on the Region's levels of economic distress), the higher Investment Rate produced by Table 1 shall be the maximum allowable Investment Rate for the Project.\n\nTable 1\n\n(2) Projects subject to a Special Need. EDA shall determine the maximum allowable Investment Rate for Projects subject to a Special Need (as determined by EDA pursuant to § 301.3(a)(1)(iii)) based on the actual or threatened overall economic situation of the Region in which the Project is located. However, unless the Project is eligible for a higher Investment Rate pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the maximum allowable Investment Rate for any Project subject to a Special Need shall be 80 percent.\n\n(3) Projects under part 303.\n\n(i) The minimum Investment Rate for Projects under part 303 of this chapter shall be 50 percent.\n\n(ii) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section or in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the maximum allowable Investment Rate for Projects under part 303 of this chapter shall be the maximum allowable Investment Rate set forth in Table 1 for the most economically distressed county or other equivalent political unit (e.g., parish) within the Region. The maximum allowable Investment Rate shall not exceed 80 percent.\n\n(iii) In compelling circumstances, the Assistant Secretary may waive the application of the first sentence in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.\n\n(4) Projects under part 306. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the maximum allowable Investment Rate for Projects under part 306 of this chapter shall generally be determined based on the relative needs (as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) of the Region which the Project will serve. As specified in section 204(c)(3) of PWEDA, the Assistant Secretary has the discretion to establish a maximum Investment Rate of up to 100 percent where the Project:\n\n(i) Merits, and is not otherwise feasible without, an increase to the Investment Rate; or\n\n(ii) Will be of no or only incidental benefit to the Eligible Recipient.\n\n(5) Special Projects. Table 2 of this paragraph sets forth the maximum allowable Investment Rate for certain special Projects as follows:\n\nTable 2\n\n(c) Federal Funding Opportunity announcements may provide additional Investment Rate criteria and standards to ensure that the level of economic distress of a Region, rather than a preference for a geographic area or a specific type of economic distress, is the primary factor in allocating Investment Assistance.\n\n[71 FR 56675, Sept. 27, 2006, as amended at 73 FR 62865, Oct. 22, 2008; 75 FR 4262, Jan. 27, 2010; 79 FR 76125, Dec. 19, 2014]",

    "content": "(a) EDA will fund both construction and non-construction infrastructure necessary to meet a Region's strategic economic development goals and needs, which in turn results in job creation. This includes infrastructure used to develop basic economic development assets as described in §§ 305.1 and 305.2 of this chapter (e.g., roads, sewers, and water lines), as well as infrastructure that supports innovation and entrepreneurship. The following are examples of innovation and entrepreneurship-related infrastructure that support job creation:\n\n(1) Business Incubation. Business incubation includes both physical facilities and business support services to advance the successful development of start-up companies by providing entrepreneurs with an array of targeted resources and services.\n\n(2) Business Acceleration. Business acceleration includes both physical facilities and an array of business support services to help new and existing businesses develop new processes or products, get products and services to market more efficiently, expand market opportunities, or increase sales and exports.\n\n(3) Venture Development Organization. A venture development organization (“VDO”) works to ensure that Regional economies operate as smoothly and efficiently as possible in support of innovation-based entrepreneurship. A VDO may make strategic investments of time, talent, and other resources toward innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology to help nurture and grow promising companies and ideas, thereby promoting and taking advantage of the innovation assets of a Region and addressing the needs of the high-growth, innovation-oriented start-up companies in the Region.\n\n(4) Proof of Concept Center. A proof of concept center serves as a hub of collaborative and entrepreneurial activity designed to accelerate the commercialization of innovations into the marketplace. Such centers support innovation-based, high growth entrepreneurship through a range of services, including technology and market evaluation, business planning and mentorship, network development, and early stage access to capital.\n\n(5) Technology Transfer. Technology transfer is the process of transferring scientific findings from one organization to another for the purpose of further development and commercialization. The process typically includes: Identifying new technologies; protecting technologies through patents and copyrights; and forming development and commercialization strategies, such as marketing and licensing, for existing private sector companies or creating start-up companies based on the technology.\n\n(b) In general, successful Projects, including innovation and entrepreneurship-related infrastructure, require the engagement of a broad range of Regional stakeholders and resources. Therefore through appropriate FFOs and program requirements, EDA will seek to advance interagency coordination by funding Projects that demonstrate effective leveraging of other Federal Agency resources based on a Region's strategic economic development goals and needs. For all types of Projects, EDA assistance may not be used to provide direct venture capital to a for-profit entity because of the restrictions set out in section 217 of PWEDA (42 U.S.C. 3154c) and part 309 of this chapter. Nonetheless, EDA may consider an application more competitive if it includes measures to address the need to provide entrepreneurs with access to early stage capital outside of the proposed EDA Project budget. See § 301.8(b).\n\n[79 FR 76127, Dec. 19, 2014, as amended at 82 FR 57053, Dec. 1, 2017]",

A conflict of interest generally exists when an Interested Party participates in a matter that has a direct and predictable effect on the Interested Party's personal or financial interests. A conflict also may exist where there is an appearance that an Interested Party's objectivity in performing his or her responsibilities under the Project is impaired. For example, an appearance of impairment of objectivity may result from an organizational conflict where, because of other activities or relationships with other persons or entities, an Interested Party is unable to render impartial assistance, services or advice to the Recipient, a participant in the Project or to the Federal government. Additionally, a conflict of interest may result from non-financial gain to an Interested Party, such as benefit to reputation or prestige in a professional field.\n\n(b) Prohibition on direct or indirect financial or personal benefits.

    "content": "(a) Partnership Planning Overview. Partnership Planning Investments support a nationwide network of Planning Organizations to provide comprehensive economic development planning services to distressed Regions. EDA makes Partnership Planning Investments to enable Planning Organizations to manage and coordinate the development and implementation of CEDS to address the unique needs of their respective Regions.\n\n(b) CEDS Process. If EDA awards Investment Assistance to a Planning Organization to develop, revise, or replace a CEDS, the Planning Organization must follow the procedures set forth in this section:\n\n(1) CEDS Strategy Committee. The Planning Organization must appoint a Strategy Committee. The Strategy Committee must represent the main economic interests of the Region, which may include Indian tribes, the private sector, State and other public officials, community leaders, private individuals, representatives of workforce development boards, institutions of higher education, minority and labor groups, and others who can contribute to and benefit from improved economic development in the relevant Region. In addition, the Strategy Committee must demonstrate the capacity to undertake a collaborative and effective planning process.\n\n(2) Public notice and comment. The Planning Organization must develop and submit to EDA a CEDS that complies with the requirements of § 303.7. Before submission to EDA, the Planning Organization must provide the public and appropriate governments and interest groups in the relevant Region with adequate notice of and opportunity to comment on the CEDS. The comment period shall be at least 30 days and the Planning Organization shall make the CEDS readily available through appropriate means of distribution, electronically and otherwise, throughout the comment period. The Planning Organization also shall make the CEDS available in hardcopy upon request. EDA may require the Planning Organization to provide any comments received and demonstrate how the comments were resolved.\n\n(3) Reports and updates. (i) After obtaining EDA approval of the CEDS, the Planning Organization must submit annually an updated CEDS performance report to EDA.\n\n(ii) The Planning Organization must submit a new or revised CEDS to EDA at least every five years, unless EDA or the Planning Organization determines that a new or revised CEDS is required earlier due to changed circumstances. In connection with the submission of a new or revised CEDS, the Planning Organization shall use its best efforts to obtain renewed commitments from participating counties or other areas within the District to support the economic development activities of the District. Provided the Planning Organization can document a good faith effort to obtain renewed commitments, the inability to secure renewed commitments shall not disqualify a CEDS update.\n\n(iii) Any updated CEDS performance report that results in a change of the requirements set forth in § 303.7(b)(1)(iii) of the EDA-accepted CEDS or any new or revised CEDS, must be available for review and comment by the public in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.\n\n(4) Inadequate CEDS. If EDA determines that implementation of the CEDS is inadequate, it will notify the Planning Organization in writing and the Planning Organization shall submit to EDA a new or revised CEDS.\n\n(5) Regional Commission notification. If any part of a Region is covered by one or more of the Regional Commissions as set forth in section 404 of PWEDA, the Planning Organization shall ensure that a copy of the CEDS is provided to the Regional Commission(s).\n\n[79 FR 76130, Dec. 19, 2014, as amended at 82 FR 57054, Dec. 1, 2017]",

    "content": "(a) General. CEDS are designed to bring together the public and private sectors in the creation of an economic roadmap to diversify and strengthen Regional economies. The CEDS should analyze the Regional economy and serve as a guide for establishing Regional goals and objectives, developing and implementing a Regional plan of action, and identifying investment priorities and funding sources. Public and private sector partnerships are critical to the implementation of the integral elements of a CEDS set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. As a performance-based plan, the CEDS will serve a critical role in a Region's efforts to defend against economic dislocations due to global trade, competition and other events resulting in the loss of jobs and private investment.\n\n(b) Strategy requirements. (1) A CEDS must be the result of a continuing economic development planning process, developed with broad-based and diverse public and private sector participation. Consistent with section 302 of PWEDA, each CEDS must promote Regional resiliency and be unique and responsive to the relevant Region. Each CEDS must include:\n\n(i) A summary of economic development conditions of the Region;\n\n(ii) An in-depth analysis of economic and community development strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (commonly known as a “SWOT” analysis);\n\n(iii) Strategies and an implementation plan to build upon the Region's strengths and opportunities and resolve the weaknesses and threats facing the Region, which should not be inconsistent with applicable State and local economic development or workforce development strategies; and\n\n(iv) Performance measures used to evaluate the Planning Organization's successful development and implementation of the CEDS.\n\n(2) EDA will publish and periodically update specific CEDS content guidelines.\n\n(c) Consideration of non-EDA funded CEDS. (1) In determining the acceptability of a CEDS prepared independently of EDA Investment Assistance or oversight for Projects under parts 305 and 307 of this chapter, EDA may in its discretion determine that the CEDS is acceptable so long as it includes all of the elements listed in paragraph (b) of this section. In certain circumstances, EDA may accept a non-EDA funded CEDS that does not contain all the elements listed in paragraph (b) of this section. In doing so, EDA shall consider the circumstances surrounding the application for Investment Assistance, including emergencies or natural disasters and the fulfillment of the requirements of section 302 of PWEDA.\n\n(2) If the CEDS for a Project under parts 305 and 307 of this chapter is developed under another federally-supported program, it must include acceptable performance measures similar to those set forth in paragraph (b) of this section and information on the state of the Regional economy. To the maximum extent practicable, the CEDS shall be consistent and coordinated with any existing economic development plan for the Region.\n\n[71 FR 56675, Sept. 27, 2006, as amended at 79 FR 76130, Dec. 19, 2014; 82 FR 57054, Dec. 1, 2017]",

Prudent Lending Practices provide for compliance with local laws and filing requirements to perfect and maintain a security interest in RLF collateral.\n\nRecapitalization Grants are Investments of additional Grant funds to increase the RLF Capital Base.\n\nReporting Period, for purposes of this subpart only, is based on the RLF Recipient's fiscal year end and is on an annual or semi-annual basis as determined by EDA.\n\nRevolving Phase means that stage of the RLF's business lending activities that commences immediately after all Grant funds have been disbursed to the RLF Recipient.\n\nRisk Analysis System refers to a set of measures defined by EDA to evaluate a Recipient's administration of its RLF Grant and that may include but is not limited to capital, assets, management, earnings, liquidity, strategic results, and financial controls.\n\nRLF Capital Base means the total value of RLF Grant assets administered by the RLF Recipient. It is equal to the amount of Grant funds used to capitalize (and recapitalize, if applicable), the RLF, plus Local Share, plus RLF Income less any eligible and reasonable administrative expenses, plus Voluntarily Contributed Capital, less any loan losses and disallowances. Except as used to pay for eligible and reasonable administrative costs associated with the RLF's operations, the RLF Capital Base is maintained in two forms at all times: As RLF Cash Available for Lending and as outstanding loan principal.\n\nRLF Cash Available for Lending means the portion of the RLF Capital Base that is held as cash and available to make loans. This excludes loans that have been committed or approved but have not yet been funded.\n\nRLF Income means interest earned on outstanding loan principal and RLF accounts holding RLF funds, all fees and charges received by the RLF, and other income generated from RLF operations. An RLF Recipient may use RLF Income only to capitalize the RLF for financing activities and to cover eligible and reasonable costs necessary to administer the RLF, unless otherwise provided for in the Grant agreement or approved in writing by EDA. RLF Income excludes repayments of principal and any interest remitted to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and § 307.20(h).\n\nRLF Recipient means the Eligible Recipient that receives an RLF Grant to manage an RLF in accordance with an RLF Plan, Prudent Lending Practices, the terms and conditions of the RLF Grant, and all applicable policies, laws, and regulations.\n\nRLF Third Party, for purposes of this subpart B only, means an Eligible Recipient or for-profit entity selected by EDA through a request for applications or Cooperative Agreement to facilitate or manage the intended liquidation of an RLF.\n\nSale means an EDA-approved sale by an RLF Recipient of its RLF loan portfolio (or a portion thereof) to a third party.

At a minimum, the amount of coverage shall be the maximum loan amount allowed for in the EDA-approved RLF Plan.\n\n(2) The RLF Recipient is required to maintain the adequacy of the RLF's accounting system and maintain and update standard RLF loan documents at all times during the duration of the RLF's operation. In addition, the RLF recipient must maintain sufficient fidelity bond coverage as described in this subsection for the duration of the RLF's operation. The RLF Recipient shall maintain records and documentation to demonstrate the requirements set out in this paragraph (a) are maintained for the duration of the RLF's operation. See also § 307.13(b)(3).\n\n(b) Timing of request for disbursements. An RLF Recipient shall request disbursements of Grant funds only to close a loan or disburse RLF funds to a borrower. The RLF Recipient must disburse the RLF funds to a borrower within 30 days of receipt of the Grant funds. Any Grant funds not disbursed within the 30 day period shall be refunded to EDA pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n(c) Amount of disbursement. The amount of a disbursement of Grant funds shall be the amount required to meet the Federal share requirement of a new RLF loan. RLF Income held during the disbursement phase may be used to reimburse eligible administrative costs. RLF Income earned and principal repaid during the Disbursement Phase must be placed in the RLF Capital Base and may be used to reimburse eligible and reasonable administrative costs, provide the requirements of § 307.12(a) and (b) are met, and increase the RLF Capital Base. RLF Income earned and principal repaid during the Disbursement Phase is not required to be used for new RLF loans, unless otherwise specified in the terms and conditions of an RLF Grant.\n\n(d) Interest-bearing account. All Grant funds disbursed by EDA to the RLF Recipient for loan obligations incurred but not yet disbursed to an eligible RLF borrower must be deposited and held in an interest-bearing account by the Recipient until an RLF loan is made to a borrower.\n\n(e) Delays. If the RLF Recipient receives Grant funds and the RLF loan disbursement is subsequently delayed beyond 30 days, the RLF Recipient must notify the applicable grants officer and return such non-disbursed funds to EDA. Grant funds returned to EDA shall be available to the RLF Recipient for future draw-downs. When returning prematurely drawn Grant funds, the RLF Recipient must clearly identify on the face of the check or in the written notification to the applicable grants officer “EDA,” the Grant award number, the words “Premature Draw,” and a brief description of the reason for returning the Grant funds.\n\n(f) Local Share. (1) Cash Local Share of the RLF may only be used for lending purposes. The cash Local Share must be used either in proportion to the Grant funds or at a faster rate than the Grant funds.\n\n(2) When an RLF has a combination of In-Kind Contributions, which must be specifically authorized in the terms and conditions of the RLF Grant and may be used to provide technical assistance to borrowers or for eligible RLF administrative costs, and cash Local Share, the cash Local Share and the Grant funds will be disbursed proportionately as needed for lending activities, provided that the last 20 percent of the Grant funds may not be disbursed until all cash Local Share has been expended. The full amount of the cash Local Share shall remain for use in the RLF.\n\n(g) Loan closing and disbursement schedule. (1) RLF loan activity must be sufficient to draw down Grant funds in accordance with the schedule prescribed in the award conditions for loan closings and disbursements to eligible RLF borrowers. The schedule usually requires that the RLF Recipient lend the entire amount of the RLF Grant within three years of the Grant award.\n\n(2) If an RLF Recipient fails to meet the prescribed lending schedule, EDA may de-obligate the non-disbursed balance of the RLF Grant. EDA may allow exceptions where:\n\n(i) Closed Loans approved prior to the schedule deadline will commence and complete disbursements within 45 days of the deadline;\n\n(ii) Closed Loans have commenced (but not completed) disbursement obligations prior to the deadline; or\n\n(iii) EDA has approved a time schedule extension pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section.\n\n(h) Time schedule extensions. (1) RLF Recipients shall promptly inform EDA in writing of any condition that may adversely affect their ability to meet the prescribed schedule deadlines. RLF Recipients must submit a written request to EDA for continued use of Grant funds beyond a missed deadline for disbursement of RLF funds. RLF Recipients must provide good reason for the delay in their extension request by demonstrating that:\n\n(i) The delay was unforeseen or beyond the control of the RLF Recipient;\n\n(ii) The financial need for the RLF still exists;\n\n(iii) The current and planned use and the anticipated benefits of the RLF will remain consistent with the current CEDS and the RLF Plan; and\n\n(iv) The proposal of a revised time schedule is reasonable. An extension request must also provide an explanation as to why no further delays are anticipated.\n\n(2) EDA is under no obligation to grant a time extension. In the event an extension is denied, EDA may de-obligate all or part of the unused Grant funds and terminate the Grant.\n\n[71 FR 56675, Sept. 27, 2006, as amended at 75 FR 4264, Jan. 27, 2010; 79 FR 76133, Dec. 19, 2014; 82 FR 57055, Dec. 1, 2017]",

    "content": "(a) Revolving Loan Fund Income requirements during the Revolving Phase. During the Revolving Phase, RLF Income must be placed into the RLF Capital Base for the purpose of making loans or paying for eligible and reasonable administrative costs associated with the RLF's operations. RLF Income may fund administrative costs, provided:\n\n(1) Such RLF Income is earned and the administrative costs are accrued in the same fiscal year of the RLF Recipient;\n\n(2) RLF Income earned, but not used for administrative costs during the same fiscal year of the RLF Recipient is made available for lending activities;\n\n(3) RLF Income shall not be withdrawn from the RLF Capital Base in a subsequent fiscal year for any purpose other than lending without the prior written consent of EDA; and\n\n(4) An RLF Recipient shall not use funds in excess of RLF Income for administrative costs unless directed otherwise in writing by EDA. In accordance with EDA's RLF Risk Analysis System, RLF Recipients are expected to keep administrative costs to a minimum in order to maintain the RLF Capital Base. The percentage of RLF Income used for administrative expenses will be one of the measures used in EDA's RLF Risk Analysis System to evaluate RLF Recipients. See also § 307.16.\n\n(b) Compliance guidance. When charging costs against RLF Income, RLF Recipients must comply with applicable Federal uniform administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements as detailed in this paragraph (b) and in the terms and conditions of the RLF Grant.\n\n(1) For RLF Grants made on or after December 26, 2014. For RLFs awarded on or after December 26, 2014 or for RLFs that have received one or more Recapitalization Grants on or after December 26, 2014, the RLF Recipient must comply with the administrative and cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 (“Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards”).\n\n(2) For RLF Grants made before December 26, 2014. For RLFs awarded before December 26, 2014, unless otherwise indicated in the terms of the Grant, the RLF Recipient must comply with the following cost principles:\n\n(i) 2 CFR part 225 (OMB Circular A-87 for State, local, and Indian tribal governments),\n\n(ii) 2 CFR part 230 (OMB Circular A-122 for non-profit organizations other than institutions of higher education, hospitals or organizations named in OMB Circular A-122 as not subject to such Circular), and\n\n(iii) 2 CFR part 220 (OMB Circular A-21 for educational institutions).\n\n(3) For all RLF Grants. For all RLF Grants, regardless of when they were awarded, the audit requirements set out as subpart F to 2 CFR part 200 apply to audits of the RLF Recipient's fiscal years beginning on or after December 26, 2014. In addition, the Compliance Supplement, which is appendix XI to 2 CFR part 200, applies as appropriate.\n\n(c) Priority of payments on defaulted and written off RLF loans. When an RLF Recipient receives proceeds on a defaulted or written off RLF loan that is not subject to liquidation pursuant to § 307.21, such proceeds shall be applied in the following order of priority:\n\n(1) First, towards any costs of collection;\n\n(2) Second, towards outstanding penalties and fees;\n\n(3) Third, towards any accrued interest to the extent due and payable; and\n\n(4) Fourth, towards any outstanding principal balance.\n\n(d) Voluntarily Contributed Capital. An RLF Recipient that wishes to inject additional capital into the RLF Capital Base to augment the amount of resources available to lend must submit a written request that specifies the source of the funds to be added. Once an RLF Recipient elects to commit Voluntarily Contributed Capital and upon approval by EDA, the Voluntarily Contributed Capital becomes an irrevocable part of the RLF Capital Base and may not be subsequently withdrawn or separated from the RLF.\n\n[71 FR 56675, Sept. 27, 2006, as amended at 73 FR 62867, Oct. 22, 2008; 79 FR 76134, Dec. 19, 2014; 82 FR 57056, Dec. 1, 2017]",

(1) RLFs shall operate in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) as in effect in the United States and the provisions outlined in the audit requirements set out as subpart F to 2 CFR part 200 and the Compliance Supplement, which is appendix XI to 2 CFR part 200, as applicable.\n\n(2) In accordance with GAAP, a loan loss reserve may be recorded in the RLF Recipient's financial statements to show the adjusted current value of an RLF's loan portfolio, provided this loan loss reserve is non-funded and is represented by a non-cash entry. However, loan loss reserves shall not be used to reduce the value of the RLF in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (“SEFA”) required as part of the RLF Recipient's audit requirements under 2 CFR part 200.\n\n(b) Interest rates—(1) General rule. An RLF Recipient may make loans to eligible borrowers at interest rates and under conditions determined by the RLF Recipient to be appropriate in achieving the goals of the RLF. The minimum interest rate an RLF Recipient may charge is four percentage points below the lesser of the current money center prime interest rate quoted in the Wall Street Journal, or the maximum interest rate allowed under State law. In no event shall the interest rate be less than the lower of four percent or 75 percent of the prime interest rate listed in the Wall Street Journal.\n\n(2) Exception. Should the prime interest rate listed in the Wall Street Journal exceed 14 percent, the minimum RLF interest rate is not required to be raised above 10 percent if doing so compromises the ability of the RLF Recipient to implement its financing strategy.\n\n(c) RLF leveraging. (1) RLF loans must leverage additional investment of at least two dollars for every one dollar of such RLF loans. This leveraging requirement applies to the RLF portfolio as a whole rather than to individual loans and is effective for the duration of the RLF's operation. To be classified as leveraged, additional investment must be made within 12 months of approval of an RLF loan, as part of the same business development project, and may include:\n\n(i) Capital invested by the borrower or others;\n\n(ii) Financing from private entities;\n\n(iii) The non-guaranteed portions and 90 percent of the guaranteed portions of any Federal loan; or\n\n(iv) Loans from other State and local lending programs.\n\n(2) Private investments shall not include accrued equity in a borrower's assets.\n\n(d) RLF certification course. EDA may establish a mandatory RLF certification program to enhance RLF Recipients' ability to administer RLF Grants in a prudent manner. If so required by EDA, the RLF Recipient must satisfactorily complete this program, and may consider the cost of attending the certification courses as an administrative cost, provided the requirements set forth in § 307.12 are satisfied.\n\n[71 FR 56675, Sept. 27, 2006, as amended at 73 FR 62868, Oct. 22, 2008; 75 FR 4264, Jan. 27, 2010; 79 FR 76134, Dec. 19, 2014; 82 FR 57057, Dec. 1, 2017]",

The potential economic benefits must be clearly consistent with the strategic objectives of the RLF;\n\n(5) Provide RLF loans to a borrower for the purpose of investing in interest-bearing accounts, certificates of deposit, or any investment unrelated to the RLF; or\n\n(6) Refinance existing debt, unless:\n\n(i) The RLF Recipient sufficiently demonstrates in the loan documentation a “sound economic justification” for the refinancing (e.g., the refinancing will support additional capital investment intended to increase business activities). For this purpose, reducing the risk of loss to an existing lender(s) or lowering the cost of financing to a borrower shall not, without other indicia, constitute a sound economic justification; or\n\n(ii) RLF Cash Available for Lending will finance the purchase of the rights of a prior lien holder during a foreclosure action which is necessary to preclude a significant loss on an RLF loan. RLF funds may be used for this purpose only if there is a high probability of receiving compensation from the sale of assets sufficient to cover an RLF's costs plus a reasonable portion of the outstanding RLF loan within a reasonable time frame approved by EDA following the date of refinancing.\n\n(7) Serve as collateral to obtain credit or any other type of financing without EDA's prior written approval;\n\n(8) Support operations or administration of the RLF Recipient; or\n\n(9) Undertake any activity that would violate the requirements found in part 314 of this chapter, including § 314.3 (“Authorized Use of Property”) and § 314.4 (“Unauthorized Use of Property”).\n\n[82 FR 57057, Dec. 1, 2017]",

If an RLF Recipient fails to operate the RLF in accordance with the RLF Plan, the terms and conditions of the RLF Grant, or this subpart, as detailed in § 307.20, EDA may require one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances:\n\n(1) Increased reporting requirements;\n\n(2) Implementation of a corrective action plan;\n\n(3) A special audit;\n\n(4) Sequestration of RLF funds;\n\n(5) Repayment of ineligible loans or other costs to the RLF;\n\n(6) Transfer or merger of the RLF in accordance with § 307.18;\n\n(7) Suspension of the RLF Grant; or\n\n(8) Termination of the RLF Grant, in whole or in part.\n\n(b) Disallowance of a portion of an RLF Grant, liquidation. If the RLF Recipient engages in certain problematic practices, EDA may disallow a corresponding proportion of the Grant or direct the RLF Recipient to transfer loans to an RLF Third Party for liquidation. Problematic practices for which EDA may disallow a portion of an RLF Grant and recover the pro-rata Federal Share (as defined in § 314.5 of this chapter) include the RLF Recipient:\n\n(1) Holding RLF Cash Available for Lending so that it is 50 percent or more of the RLF Capital Base for 24 months without an EDA-approved extension request;\n\n(2) Failing to disburse the EDA funds in accordance with the time schedule prescribed in the RLF Grant; or\n\n(3) Determining that it does not wish to further invest in the RLF or cannot maintain operations at the degree originally contemplated upon receipt of the RLF Grant and requests that a portion of the RLF Grant be disallowed, and EDA agrees to the disallowance.\n\n(c) Termination or suspension. To maintain effective control over and accountability of RLF Grant funds and assets, EDA shall determine the manner and timing of any suspension or termination action. EDA may require the RLF Recipient to repay the Federal Share in a lump-sum payment or enter into a Sale, or EDA may agree to enter into a repayment agreement with the RLF Recipient for repayment of the Federal Share.\n\n(d) Termination, liquidation upon termination. When EDA approves the termination of an RLF Grant, EDA must make all efforts to recover the pro rata Federal Share (as defined in § 314.5 of this chapter). EDA may assign or transfer assets of the RLF to an RLF Third Party for liquidation. The following terms will govern any liquidation:\n\n(1) EDA shall have sole discretion in choosing the RLF Third Party;\n\n(2) The RLF Third Party may be an Eligible Applicant or a for-profit organization not otherwise eligible for Investment Assistance;\n\n(3) EDA may enter into an agreement with the RLF Third Party to liquidate the assets of one or more RLFs or RLF Recipients;\n\n(4) EDA may allow the RLF Third Party to retain a portion of the RLF assets, consistent with the agreement referenced in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, as reasonable compensation for services rendered in the liquidation; and\n\n(5) EDA may require additional reasonable terms and conditions.\n\n(e) Distribution of proceeds. The proceeds resulting from any liquidation upon termination shall be distributed in the following order of priority:\n\n(1) First, for any third party liquidation costs;\n\n(2) Second, for the payment of EDA's Federal Share; and\n\n(3) Third, if any proceeds remain, to the RLF Recipient.\n\n(f) RLF Recipient's request to terminate. EDA may approve a request from an RLF Recipient to terminate an RLF Grant. The RLF Recipient must compensate the Federal Government for the pro rata Federal Share of the RLF Capital Base.\n\n(g) Distribution of proceeds upon termination.

Encumbrances already in place and disclosed to EDA at the time EDA approves the Project where EDA, in its sole discretion, determines that:\n\n(i) The requirements of § 314.7(b) are met;\n\n(ii) Consistent with paragraphs (b)(4)(iv) and (b)(5)(iv) of this section, the terms and conditions of the encumbrance are satisfactory; and\n\n(iii) Consistent with paragraphs (b)(4)(v) and (b)(5)(v) of this section, there is a reasonable expectation that the Recipient will not default on its obligations.\n\n(4) Encumbrances proposed proximate to Project approval. Encumbrances required to secure debt, including time and maturity-limited debt, that finances the Project Property at the same proximate time that EDA approves the Project when all of the following are met:\n\n(i) EDA, in its sole discretion, determines that there is good cause and legal authority to waive paragraph (a) of this section;\n\n(ii) All proceeds secured by the encumbrance on the Property shall be available only to the Recipient and shall be used only for the Project for which the Investment Assistance applies, for related activities of which the Project is an essential part, or other activities that EDA determines are authorized under PWEDA;\n\n(iii) A grantor or lender will not provide funds without the security of a lien on the Property;\n\n(iv) The terms and conditions of the encumbrance are satisfactory to EDA; and\n\n(v) There is a reasonable expectation, as determined by EDA, that the Recipient will not default on its obligations. In determining whether an expectation is reasonable for purposes of this paragraph, EDA shall take into account whether:\n\n(A) A Recipient that is a non-profit organization is joined in the Project with a co-Recipient that is a public body and all co-Recipients are jointly and severally responsible;\n\n(B) A Recipient that is a non-profit organization is financially strong and is an established organization with sufficient organizational life to demonstrate stability over time;\n\n(C) The approximate value of the Project Property so that the total amount of all debt plus the Federal share of cost as reflected on the EDA Investment award, and any amendments as applicable, does not exceed the value of the Project Property as improved; and\n\n(D) Such other factors as EDA deems appropriate.\n\n(5) Encumbrances proposed after Project approval.

    "content": "(a) General title requirement. Except in those limited circumstances identified in paragraph (c) of this section, at the time Investment Assistance is awarded, the Recipient must hold title to Project Real Property, which, as noted in § 314.1 in the definition of “Real Property” includes land that is served by the construction of Project infrastructure (such as roads, sewers, and water lines) and where the infrastructure contributes to the value of such land as a specific purpose of the Project. The Recipient must maintain title to Project Real Property at all times during the Estimated Useful Life of the Project, except in those limited circumstances as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The Recipient also must furnish evidence, satisfactory in form and substance to EDA, that title to Project Real Property (other than property of the United States) is vested in the Recipient and that any easements, rights-of-way, State or local government permits, long-term leases, or other items required for the Project have been or will be obtained by the Recipient within an acceptable time, as determined by EDA.\n\n(b) Disclosure of encumbrances. (1) The Recipient must disclose to EDA all encumbrances, including the following:\n\n(i) Liens;\n\n(ii) Mortgages;\n\n(iii) Reservations;\n\n(iv) Reversionary interests; and\n\n(v) Other restrictions on title or on the Recipient's interest in the Property.\n\n(2) No encumbrance will be acceptable if, as determined by EDA, the encumbrance interferes with the construction, use, operation or maintenance of the Project during its Estimated Useful Life.\n\n(c) Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section that the Recipient hold title to Project Real Property at the time Investment Assistance is awarded and at all times during the Estimated Useful Life of the Project.\n\n(1) Project Real Property acquisition. Where the acquisition of Project Real Property is contemplated as part of an Investment Assistance award, EDA may determine that an agreement for the Recipient to purchase the Project Real Property will be acceptable for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section if:\n\n(i) The Recipient provides EDA with reasonable assurances that it will obtain fee title to the Real Property prior to or concurrent with the initial disbursement of the Investment Assistance; and\n\n(ii) EDA, in its sole discretion, determines that the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement adequately safeguard the Federal Government's interest in the Project Real Property.\n\n(2) Leasehold interests. EDA may determine that a long-term leasehold interest for a period not less than the Estimated Useful Life of Project Real Property will be acceptable for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section if:\n\n(i) Fee title to the Real Property is not otherwise obtainable; and\n\n(ii) EDA, in its sole discretion, determines that the terms and conditions of the lease adequately safeguard the Federal government's interest in the Real Property and demonstrate the economic development and public benefits of the leasehold transaction.\n\n(3) Railroad right-of-way construction. When a Project includes construction within a railroad's right-of-way or over a railroad crossing, EDA may find it acceptable for the work to be completed by the railroad and for the railroad to continue to own, operate, and maintain that portion of the Project, if required by the railroad; and provided that, the construction is a minor but essential component of the Project.\n\n(4) State or local government owned roadway or highway construction. When the Project includes construction on a State or local government owned roadway or highway the owner of which is not the Recipient, EDA may allow the Project to be constructed in whole or in part in the right-of-way of such public roadway or highway, provided that:\n\n(i) All EDA-funded construction is completed in accordance with EDA requirements;\n\n(ii) The Recipient confirms in writing to EDA, satisfactory to EDA, that:\n\n(A) The Recipient is committed during the Estimated Useful Life of the Project to operate, maintain and repair all improvements for the Project consistent with the Investment Assistance; and\n\n(B) If at any time during the Estimated Useful Life of the Project any or all of the improvements in the Project within the State or local government owned roadway or highway are relocated for any reason pursuant to requirements of the owner of the public roadway or highway, the Recipient shall be responsible for accomplishing such relocation, including expending the Recipient's own funds as necessary, so that the Project continues as authorized by the Investment Assistance; and\n\n(iii) The Recipient obtains all written authorizations (i.e., State or county permit(s)) necessary for the Project to be constructed within the public roadway or highway, copies of which shall be submitted to EDA. Such authorizations shall contain no time limits that EDA determines substantially restrict the use of the public roadway or highway for the Project during the Estimated Useful Life of the Project.\n\n(5) Construction of Recipient-owned facilities to serve Recipient or privately owned Real Property—(i) General. At EDA's discretion, when an authorized purpose of the Project is to construct Recipient-owned facilities to serve Recipient or privately owned Project Real Property, including industrial or commercial parks, so that the Recipient or Owner may sell or lease parcels of the Project Real Property to private parties, such ownership, sale, or lease, as applicable, is permitted so long as:\n\n(A) In cases where an authorized purpose of the Project is to sell Project Real Property, the Recipient or Owner, as applicable, provides evidence sufficient to EDA that it holds title to the Project Real Property intended for sale or lease prior to the disbursement of any portion of the Investment Assistance and will retain title until the sale of the Property in accordance with paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(C) through (E) of this section;\n\n(B) In cases where an authorized purpose of the Project is to lease Project Real Property, the Recipient or Owner, as applicable, provides evidence sufficient to EDA that it holds title to the Project Real Property intended for lease prior to the disbursement of any portion of the Investment Assistance and will retain title for the entire Estimated Useful Life of the Project;\n\n(C) The Recipient provides adequate assurances that the Project and the development of land and improvements on the Recipient or privately owned Project Real Property to be served by or that provides the economic justification for the Project will be completed according to the terms of the Investment Assistance;\n\n(D) The sale or lease of any portion of the Project or of Project Real Property served by the Project or that provides the economic justification for the Project during the Project's Estimated Useful Life must be for Adequate Consideration and the terms and conditions of the Investment Assistance and the purpose(s) of the Project must continue to be fulfilled after such sale or lease; and\n\n(ii) Additional conditions on sale or lease. EDA also may condition the sale or lease on the satisfaction by the Recipient, Owner, purchaser, or lessee (as the case may be) of any additional requirements that EDA may impose, including EDA's pre-approval of the sale or lease.\n\n(iii) Agreement between Recipient and Owner. In addition to paragraphs (c)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section, when an authorized purpose of the Project is to construct facilities to serve privately owned Real Property, the Recipient and the Owner must agree to use the Real Property improved or benefitted by the EDA Investment Assistance only for the authorized purposes of the Project and in a manner consistent with the terms and conditions of the EDA Investment Assistance for the Estimated Useful Life of the Project.\n\n(iv) Unauthorized Use and compensation of Federal Share. EDA may deem that a violation of this paragraph (c)(5) by the Recipient, Owner, purchaser, or lessee (as the case may be) constitutes an Unauthorized Use of the Real Property and the Recipient must agree to compensate EDA for the Federal government's Federal Share of the Project in the case of such Unauthorized Use.\n\n[71 FR 56675, Sept. 27, 2006, as amended at 73 FR 62870, Oct. 22, 2008; 79 FR 76137, Dec. 19, 2014; 82 FR 57061, Dec. 1, 2017]",

    "content": "(a) General. As provided in § 314.2, the Federal Interest in Project Property extends for the duration of the Estimated Useful Life of the Project, which is determined by EDA at the time of Investment award. Upon request of the Recipient, EDA will release the Federal Interest in Project Property upon expiration of the Estimated Useful Life as established in the terms and conditions of the Investment Assistance and in accord with the requirements of this section and part. This section provides procedures to obtain a release of the Federal Interest in Project Property.\n\n(b) Release of the Federal Interest after the expiration of the Estimated Useful Life. At the expiration of a Project's Estimated Useful Life and upon the written request of a recipient, the Assistant Secretary may release the Federal Interest in Project Property if EDA determines that the Recipient has made a good faith effort to fulfill all terms and conditions of the Investment Assistance. The determination provided for in this paragraph (b) shall be established at the time of Recipient's written request and shall be based, at least in part, on the facts and circumstances provided in writing by the Recipient. For a Project in which a Recorded Statement as provided for in §§ 314.8 and 314.9 has been recorded, EDA will provide for the release by executing an instrument in recordable form. The release will terminate the Investment as of the date of its execution and satisfy the Recorded Statement. See paragraph (e) of this section for limitations and covenants of use that are applicable to any release of the Federal Interest.\n\n(c) Release prior to the expiration of the Estimated Useful Life. If the Recipient will no longer use the Project Property in accord with the requirements of the terms and conditions of the Investment within the time period of the Estimated Useful Life, EDA will determine if such use by the Recipient constitutes an Unauthorized Use of Property and require compensation for the Federal Interest as provided in § 314.4 and this section. EDA may release the Federal Interest in connection with such Property only upon receipt of full payment in compensation of the Federal Interest and thereafter will have no further interest in the ownership, use, or Disposition of the Property, except for the nondiscrimination requirements set forth in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.\n\n(d) Release of the Federal Interest before the expiration of the Estimated Useful Life, but 20 years after the award of Investment Assistance. In accord with section 601(d)(2) of PWEDA, upon the request of a Recipient and before the expiration of the Estimated Useful Life of a Project, but where 20 years have elapsed since the award of Investment Assistance, EDA may release any Real Property or tangible Personal Property interest held by EDA, if EDA determines:\n\n(1) The Recipient has made a good faith effort to fulfill all terms and conditions of the award of Investment Assistance; and\n\n(2) The economic development benefits as set out in the award of Investment Assistance have been achieved.\n\n(3) See paragraph (e) of this section for limitations and covenants of use that are applicable to any release of the Federal Interest.\n\n(e) Limitations and Covenant of Use. (1) EDA's release of the Federal Interest pursuant to this section is not automatic; it requires EDA's approval, which will not be withheld except for good cause or as otherwise required by law, as determined in EDA's sole discretion. As deemed appropriate, EDA may require the Recipient to take some action as a condition of the release.\n\n(2) In determining whether to release the Federal Interest, EDA will review EDA's legal authority to release its interest, including the Recipient's performance under and conformance with the terms and conditions of the Investment Assistance; any use of Project Property in violation of § 314.3 or § 314.4; and other such factors as EDA deems appropriate. When requesting a release of the Federal Interest pursuant to this section, the Recipient will be required to disclose to EDA the intended future use of the Real Property or the tangible Personal Property for which the release is requested.\n\n(i) A Recipient not intending to use the Real Property or tangible Personal Property for explicitly religious activities following EDA's release will be required to execute a covenant of use. A covenant of use with respect to Real Property shall be recorded in the jurisdiction where the Real Property is located in accordance with § 314.8. A covenant of use with respect to items of tangible Personal Property shall be perfected and recorded in accordance with applicable law, with continuances re-filed as appropriate. See § 314.9. A covenant of use shall (at a minimum) prohibit the use of the Real Property or the tangible Personal Property for explicitly religious activities in violation of applicable Federal law.\n\n(ii) EDA may require a Recipient (or its successors in interest) that intends or foresees the use of Real Property or tangible Personal Property for explicitly religious activities following the release of the Federal Interest to compensate EDA for the Federal Share of such Property. If such compensation is made, no covenant with respect to explicitly religious activities will be required as a condition of the release. EDA recommends that any Recipient who intends or foresees the use of Real Property or tangible Personal Property (including by successors of the Recipient) for explicitly religious activities to contact EDA well in advance of requesting a release pursuant to this section.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding any release of the Federal Interest under this section, including a release upon a Recipient's compensation for the Federal Share, a Recipient must ensure that Project Property is not used in violation of nondiscrimination requirements set forth in § 302.20 of this chapter. Accordingly, upon the release of the Federal Interest, the Recipient must execute a covenant of use that prohibits use of Real Property or tangible Personal Property for any purpose that would violate the nondiscrimination requirements set forth in § 302.20 of this chapter.\n\n(i) With respect to Real Property, the Recipient must record a covenant under this subsection in the jurisdiction where the Real Property is located in accordance with § 314.8.\n\n(ii) With respect to items of tangible Personal Property, the Recipient must perfect and record a covenant under this subsection in accordance with applicable law, with continuances re-filed as appropriate, in accordance with § 314.9.\n\n[79 FR 76139, Dec. 19, 2014, as amended at 82 FR 57062, Dec. 1, 2017]",

The type of assistance provided is determined by EDA and may include one or more of the following:\n\n(1) Assistance in preparing a Firm's petition for certification of eligibility;\n\n(2) Assistance to a Certified Firm in developing an Adjustment Proposal for the Firm; and\n\n(3) Assistance to a Certified Firm in implementing an Adjustment Proposal.\n\nAdjustment Proposal means a Certified Firm's plan for improving the Firm's competitiveness in the marketplace.\n\nCertified Firm means a Firm which has been determined by EDA to be eligible to apply for Adjustment Assistance.\n\nConfidential Business Information means any information submitted to EDA or a TAAC by a Firm that concerns or relates to trade secrets for commercial or financial purposes, which is exempt from public disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(4) and 15 CFR part 4.\n\nContributed Importantly, with respect to an Increase in Imports, refers to a cause which is important but not necessarily more important than any other cause. Imports will not be considered to have Contributed Importantly if other factors were so dominant, acting singly or in combination, that the worker separation or threat thereof or decline in sales or production would have been essentially the same, irrespective of the influence of imports.\n\nDecreased Absolutely means a Firm's sales or production has declined by a minimum of five percent relative to its sales or production during the applicable prior time period, and this decline is:\n\n(1) Independent of industry or market fluctuations; and\n\n(2) Relative only to the previous performance of the Firm, unless EDA determines that these limitations in a given case would not be consistent with the purposes of the Trade Act.\n\nDirectly Competitive or Like means imported articles or services that compete with and are substantially equivalent for commercial purposes (i.e., are adapted for the same function or use and are essentially interchangeable) as the Firm's articles or services. For the purposes of this term, any Firm that engages in exploring or drilling for oil or natural gas, or otherwise produces oil or natural gas, shall be considered to be producing articles directly competitive with imports of oil and with imports of natural gas.\n\nFirm means an individual proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, association, corporation (includes a development corporation), business trust, cooperative, trustee in bankruptcy or receiver under court decree, and includes fishing, agricultural or service sector entities and those which explore, drill or otherwise produce oil or natural gas. See also the definition of Service Sector Firm. Pursuant to section 259 of chapter 3 of title II of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2351), a Firm, together with any predecessor or successor firm, or any affiliated firm controlled or substantially beneficially owned by substantially the same person, may be considered a single Firm where necessary to prevent Unjustifiable Benefits. For purposes of receiving benefits under this part, when a Firm owns or controls other Firms, the Firm and such other Firms may be considered a single Firm when they produce or supply like or Directly Competitive articles or services or are exerting essential economic control over one or more production facilities. Accordingly, such other Firms may include a(n):\n\n(1) Predecessor—see the following definition for Successor;\n\n(2) Successor—a newly established Firm (that has been in business less than two years) which has purchased substantially all of the assets of a previously operating company (or in some cases a whole distinct division) (such prior company, unit or division, a ‘Predecessor’) and is able to demonstrate that it continued the operations of the Predecessor which has operated as an autonomous unit, provided that there were no significant transactions between the Predecessor unit and any related parent, subsidiary, or affiliate that would have affected its past performance, and that separate records are available for the Predecessor's operations for at least two years before the petition is submitted. The Successor Firm must have continued virtually all of the Predecessor Firm's operations by producing the same type of products or services, in the same plant, utilizing most of the same machinery and equipment and most of its former workers, and the Predecessor Firm must no longer be in existence;\n\n(3) Affiliate—a company (either foreign or domestic) controlled or substantially beneficially owned by substantially the same person or persons that own or control the Firm filing the petition; or\n\n(4) Subsidiary—a company (either foreign or domestic) that is wholly owned or effectively controlled by another company. A Firm that has been acquired by another Firm but which maintains operations independent of the acquiring Firm is considered an Independent Subsidiary and may be considered separately from the acquiring Firm as eligible for TAAF assistance.\n\nIncrease in Imports means an increase in imports of Directly Competitive or Like Articles or Services with articles produced or services supplied by a Firm.\n\nLike Articles or Services means any articles or services, as applicable, which are substantially identical in their intrinsic characteristics.\n\nPartial Separation occurs when there has been no increase in overall employment at the Firm and either of the following applies:\n\n(1) A reduction in an employee's work hours to 80 percent or less of the employee's average weekly hours during the year of such reductions as compared to the preceding year; or\n\n(2) A reduction in the employee's weekly wage to 80 percent or less of his/her average weekly wage during the year of such reduction as compared to the preceding year.\n\nPerson means an individual, organization or group.\n\nRecord means any of the following:\n\n(1) A petition for certification of eligibility to qualify for Adjustment Assistance;\n\n(2) Any supporting information submitted by a petitioner;\n\n(3) The report of an EDA investigation with respect to petition; and\n\n(4) Any information developed during an investigation or in connection with any public hearing held on a petition.\n\nService Sector Firm means a Firm engaged in the business of supplying services.\n\nSignificant Number or Proportion of Workers means five percent of a Firm's work force or 50 workers, whichever is less, unless EDA determines that these limitations in a given case would not be consistent with the purposes of the Trade Act. An individual farmer or fisherman is considered a Significant Number or Proportion of Workers.\n\nSubstantial Interest means a direct material economic interest in the certification or non-certification of the petitioner.\n\nTAAC means a Trade Adjustment Assistance Center, as more fully described in § 315.5.\n\nThreat of Total or Partial Separation means, with respect to any group of workers, one or more events or circumstances clearly demonstrating that a Total or Partial Separation is imminent.\n\nTotal Separation means the laying off or termination of employment of an employee in a Firm for lack of work.\n\nUnjustifiable Benefits means Adjustment Assistance inappropriately accruing to the benefit of:\n\n(1) Other Firms that would not otherwise be eligible when provided to a Firm; or\n\n(2) Any predecessor or successor Firm, or any affiliated Firm controlled or substantially beneficially owned by substantially the same person, rather than treating these entities as a single Firm.\n\n[74 FR 41598, Aug. 18, 2009, as amended at 85 FR 8379, Feb. 14, 2020]",

    "content": "(a) General. Firms apply for certification through a TAAC by completing a petition for certification. The TAAC will assist Firms in completing such petitions at no cost to the Firms. EDA evaluates Firms' petitions based on the requirements set forth in § 315.7. EDA may certify a Firm as eligible to apply for Adjustment Assistance under section 251(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2341) if it determines that the petition for certification meets one of the minimum certification thresholds set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. In order to be certified, a Firm must meet the criteria listed under any one of the five circumstances described in paragraph (b) of this section.\n\n(b) Minimum certification thresholds—(1) Twelve-month decline. Based upon a comparison of the most recent 12-month period for which data are available and the immediately preceding 12-month period:\n\n(i) A Significant Number or Proportion of Workers in the Firm has undergone Total or Partial Separation or a Threat of Total or Partial Separation;\n\n(ii) Either sales or production, or both, of the Firm has Decreased Absolutely; or sales or production, or both, of any article or service that accounted for not less than 25 percent of the total production or sales of the Firm during the 12-month period preceding the most recent 12-month period for which data are available have Decreased Absolutely; and\n\n(iii) An Increase in Imports has Contributed Importantly to the applicable Total or Partial Separation or Threat of Total or Partial Separation, and to the applicable decline in sales or production or supply of services.\n\n(2) Twelve-month versus twenty-four month decline. Based upon a comparison of the most recent 12-month period for which data are available and the immediately preceding 24-month period:\n\n(i) A Significant Number or Proportion of Workers in the Firm has undergone Total or Partial Separation or a Threat of Total or Partial Separation;\n\n(ii) Either average annual sales or production, or both, of the Firm has Decreased Absolutely; or average annual sales or production, or both, of any article or service that accounted for not less than 25 percent of the total production or sales of the Firm during the 24-month period preceding the most recent 12-month period for which data are available have Decreased Absolutely; and\n\n(iii) An Increase in Imports has Contributed Importantly to the applicable Total or Partial Separation or Threat of Total or Partial Separation, and to the applicable decline in sales or production or supply of services.\n\n(3) Twelve-month versus thirty-six month decline. Based upon a comparison of the most recent 12-month period for which data are available and the immediately preceding 36-month period:\n\n(i) A Significant Number or Proportion of Workers in the Firm has undergone Total or Partial Separation or a Threat of Total or Partial Separation;\n\n(ii) Either average annual sales or production, or both, of the Firm has Decreased Absolutely; or average annual sales or production, or both, of any article or service that accounted for not less than 25 percent of the total production or sales of the Firm during the 36-month period preceding the most recent 12-month period for which data are available have Decreased Absolutely; and\n\n(iii) An Increase in Imports has Contributed Importantly to the applicable Total or Partial Separation or Threat of Total or Partial Separation, and to the applicable decline in sales or production or supply of services.\n\n(4) Interim sales or production decline. Based upon an interim sales or production decline:\n\n(i) Sales or production has Decreased Absolutely for, at minimum, the most recent six-month period during the most recent 12-month period for which data are available as compared to the same six-month period during the immediately preceding 12-month period;\n\n(ii) During the same base and comparative period of time as sales or production has Decreased Absolutely, a Significant Number or Proportion of Workers in such Firm has undergone Total or Partial Separation or a Threat of Total or Partial Separation; and\n\n(iii) During the same base and comparative period of time as sales or production has Decreased Absolutely, an Increase in Imports has Contributed Importantly to the applicable Total or Partial Separation or Threat of Total or Partial Separation, and to the applicable decline in sales or production or supply of services.\n\n(5) Interim employment decline. Based upon an interim employment decline:\n\n(i) A Significant Number or Proportion of Workers in such Firm has undergone Total or Partial Separation or a Threat of Total or Partial Separation during, at a minimum, the most recent six-month period during the most recent 12-month period for which data are available as compared to the same six-month period during the immediately preceding 12-month period; and\n\n(ii) Either sales or production of the Firm has Decreased Absolutely during the 12-month period preceding the most recent 12-month period for which data are available; and\n\n(iii) An Increase in Imports has Contributed Importantly to the applicable Total or Partial Separation or Threat of Total or Partial Separation, and to the applicable decline in sales or production or supply of services.\n\n(c) Evidence of an increase in imports. EDA may consider as evidence of an Increase in Imports a certification from the Firm's customers that account for a significant percentage of the Firm's decrease in sales or production, that they have increased their purchase of imports of Directly Competitive or Like Articles or Services from a foreign country, either absolutely or relative to their acquisition of such Like Articles or Services from suppliers located in the United States. Such certification from a Firm's customer must be submitted directly to a TAAC or to EDA.",

To the extent practicable, the minutes of a Board meeting shall be corrected and approved at the next meeting of the Board.\n\n(e) Use of conference call communications equipment. Any member may participate in a meeting of the Board through the use of conference call, telephone or similar communications equipment, by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can simultaneously speak to and hear each other. Any member so participating in a meeting shall be deemed present for all purposes. Actions taken by the Board at meetings conducted through the use of such equipment, including the votes of each member, shall be recorded in the usual manner in the minutes of the meetings of the Board.\n\n(f) Actions between meetings. When, in the judgment of the Chairman, circumstances occur making it desirable for the Board to consider action when it is not feasible to call a meeting, the relevant information and recommendations for action may be transmitted to the members by the Secretary of the Board and the voting members may communicate their votes to the Chairman in writing (including an action signed in counterpart by each Board member), electronically, or orally (including telephone communication). Any action taken under this paragraph has the same effect as an action taken at a meeting. Any such action shall be recorded in the minutes.\n\n(g) Delegations of authority. The Board may delegate authority, subject to such terms and conditions as the Board deems appropriate, to the Executive Director, the General Counsel, or the Secretary of the Board, to take certain actions not required by the Act to be taken by the Board. All delegations shall be made pursuant to resolutions of the Board and recorded in writing, whether in the minutes of a meeting or otherwise. Any action taken pursuant to delegated authority has the effect of an action taken by the Board.",

    "content": "(a) Definitions. All terms used in this section which are defined in 5 U.S.C. 551 or 5 U.S.C. 552 shall have the same meaning in this section. In addition the following definitions apply to this section:\n\n(1) FOIA, as used in this section, means the “Freedom of Information Act,” as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552.\n\n(2) Commercial use request means a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made.\n\n(3) Direct costs mean those expenditures that the Board actually incurs in searching for, reviewing, and duplicating documents in response to a request made under paragraph (c) of this section. Direct costs include, for example, the labor costs of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits). Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are kept.\n\n(4) Duplication means the process of making a copy of a document in response to a request for disclosure of records or for inspection of original records that contain exempt material or that otherwise cannot be inspected directly. Among others, such copies may take the form of paper, microfilm, audiovisual materials, or machine-readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk).\n\n(5) Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, or an institution of undergraduate higher education, graduate higher education, professional education, or an institution of vocational education that operates a program of scholarly research.\n\n(6) Noncommercial scientific institution refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis (as that term is used in this section) and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.\n\n(7) News means information about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include, but are not limited to, television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of newspapers and other periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. “Freelance” journalists may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it.\n\n(8) Representative of the news media means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the general public.\n\n(9) Review means the process of examining documents, located in response to a request for access, to determine whether any portion of a document is exempt information. It includes doing all that is necessary to excise the documents and otherwise to prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.\n\n(10) Search means the process of looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification within documents. Searches may be done manually or by computer.\n\n(b) Records available for public inspection and copying—(1) Types of records made available. The information in this section is furnished for the guidance of the public and in compliance with the requirements of the Freedom of Information FOIA, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552)(FOIA). This section sets forth the procedures the Board follows to make publicly available the materials specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). These materials shall be made available for inspection and copying at the Board's Freedom of Information Office pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). Information routinely provided to the public as part of a regular Board activity (for example, press releases) may be provided to the public without following this section.\n\n(2) Reading room procedures. Information available under this section is available for inspection and copying, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. weekdays, at the Freedom of Information Office of the Board, Steel Guarantee Loan Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.\n\n(3) Electronic records. Information available under this section that was created on or after November 1, 1996, shall also be available on the Board's website found at http://elb.osec.doc.gov and at http://elb.commerce.gov.\n\n(c) Records available to the public on request—(1) Types of records made available. All records of the Board that are not available under paragraph (b) of this section shall be made available upon request, pursuant to the procedures in this section and the exceptions set forth in the FOIA. The Board's policy is to make discretionary disclosures of records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption, but this policy does not create any right enforceable in court.\n\n(2) Procedures for requesting records. A request for records shall reasonably describe the records in a way that enables the Board's staff to identify and produce the records with reasonable effort and without unduly burdening or significantly interfering with any of the Board's operations. The request shall be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the Board, Steel Guarantee Loan Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; or sent by facsimile to the Secretary of the Board. The request shall be clearly marked FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST.\n\n(3) Contents of request. The request shall contain the following information:\n\n(i) The name and address of the requester, and the telephone number at which the requester can be reached during normal business hours;\n\n(ii) Whether the requested information is intended for commercial use, or whether the requester represents an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, or news media;\n\n(iii) A statement agreeing to pay the applicable fees, or a statement identifying any fee limitation desired, or a request for a waiver or reduction of fees that satisfies paragraph (f) of this section.\n\n(d) Processing requests—(1) Priority of responses. The date of receipt for any request, including one that is addressed incorrectly or that is referred to the Board by another agency, is the date the Secretary of the Board actually receives the request. The Secretary of the Board shall normally process requests in the order they are received. However, in the Secretary of the Board's discretion, the Board may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based on the number of pages involved, or some other measure of the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request, and whether the request qualifies for expedited processing as described in paragraph (d)(2), of this section. When using multitrack processing, the Secretary of the Board may provide requesters in the slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing. The Secretary of the Board shall contact the requester by telephone or by letter, whichever is most efficient in each case.\n\n(2) Expedited processing. (i) A person may request expedited access to records by submitting a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, that demonstrates a compelling need for the records, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(E)(v).\n\n(ii) The Secretary of the Board shall notify a requester of the determination whether to grant or deny a request for expedited processing within ten working days of receipt of the request. If the Secretary of the Board grants the request for expedited processing, the Board shall process the request for access to information as soon as practicable. If the Secretary of the Board denies a request for expedited processing, the requester may file an appeal pursuant to the procedures set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, and the Board shall respond to the appeal within twenty days after the appeal was received by the Board.\n\n(3) Time limits. The time for response to requests shall be 20 working days, except:\n\n(i) In the case of expedited treatment under paragraph (d)(2) of this section;\n\n(ii) Where the running of such time is suspended for payment of fees pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section;\n\n(iii) Where the estimated charge is less than $250, and the requester does not guarantee payment pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section; or\n\n(iv) In unusual circumstances, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(iii), the time limit may be extended for a period of time not to exceed 10 working days as provided by written notice to the requester, setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched; or such alternative time period as mutually agreed to by the Secretary of the Board and the requester when the Secretary of the Board notifies the requester that the request cannot be processed in the specified time limit.\n\n(4) Response to request. In response to a request that satisfies paragraph (c) of this section, an appropriate search shall be conducted of records in the custody and control of the Board on the date of receipt of the request, and a review made of any responsive information located. The Secretary of the Board shall notify the requester of:\n\n(i) The Secretary of the Board's determination of the request and the reasons therefor;\n\n(ii) The information withheld, and the basis for withholding; and\n\n(iii) The right to appeal any denial or partial denial, pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n(5) Referral to another agency. To the extent a request covers documents that were created by, obtained from, classified by, or is in the primary interest of another agency, the Secretary of the Board may refer the request to that agency for a direct response by that agency and inform the requester promptly of the referral. The Secretary of the Board shall consult with another Federal agency before responding to a requester if the Board receives a request for a record in which:\n\n(i) Another Federal agency subject to the FOIA has a significant interest, but not the primary interest; or\n\n(ii) Another Federal agency not subject to the FOIA has the primary interest or a significant interest. Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to have the primary interest in it.\n\n(6) Providing responsive records. (i) A copy of records or portions of records responsive to the request shall be sent to the requester by regular U.S. mail to the address indicated in the request, unless the requester elects to take delivery of the documents at the Board's Freedom of Information Office or makes other acceptable arrangements, or the Secretary of the Board deems it appropriate to send the documents by another means. The Secretary of the Board shall provide a copy of the record in any form or format requested if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format, but the Secretary of the Board need not provide more than one copy of any record to a requester.\n\n(ii) The Secretary of the Board shall provide any reasonably segregable portion of a record that is responsive to the request after deleting those portions that are exempt under the FOIA or this section.\n\n(iii) Except where disclosure is expressly prohibited by statute, regulation, or order, the Secretary of the Board may authorize the release of records that are exempt from mandatory disclosure whenever the Board or designated Board members determine that there would be no foreseeable harm in such disclosure.\n\n(iv) The Board is not required in response to the request to create records or otherwise to prepare new records.\n\n(7) Prohibition against disclosure. Except as provided in this part, no officer, employee, or agent of the Board shall disclose or permit the disclosure of any unpublished information of the Board to any person (other than Board officers, employees, or agents properly entitled to such information for the performance of official duties), unless required by law.\n\n(e) Appeals. (1) Any person denied access to Board records requested under paragraph (c) of this section, denied expedited processing under paragraph (d) of this section, or denied a waiver of fees under paragraph (f) of this section may file a written appeal within 30 calendar days after the date of such denial with the Board. The written appeal shall prominently display the phrase FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT APPEAL on the first page, and shall be addressed to the General Counsel of the Board, Steel Guarantee Loan Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; or sent by facsimile to the General Counsel of the Board. The appeal shall include a copy of the original request, the initial denial, if any, and a statement of the reasons why the requested records should be made available and why the initial denial was in error.\n\n(2) The General Counsel of the Board shall make a determination regarding any appeal within 20 working days of actual receipt of the appeal, and the determination letter shall notify the appealing party of the right to seek judicial review in event of denial.\n\n(f) Fee schedules; waiver of fees—\n\n(1) Fee schedule. The fees applicable to a request for records pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section are set forth in the uniform fee schedule at the end of this paragraph (f).\n\n(i) Search. (A) Search fees shall be charged for all requests—other than requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media—subject to the limitations of paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section. The Secretary of the Board shall charge for time spent searching even if no responsive record is located or if the Secretary of the Board withholds the record(s) located as entirely exempt from disclosure.\n\nSearch fees shall be the direct costs of conducting the search by the involved employees.\n\n(B) For computer searches of records, requesters will be charged the direct costs of conducting the search, although certain requesters (as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section will be charged no search fee and certain other requesters (as provided in paragraph (f)(3)) are entitled to the cost equivalent of two hours of manual search time without charge. These direct costs include the costs, attributable to the search, of operating a central processing unit and operator/programmer salary.\n\n(ii) Duplication. Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, subject to the limitations of paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section. For a paper photocopy of a record (no more than one copy of which need be supplied), the fee shall be 15 cents per page. For copies produced by computer, such as tapes or printouts, the Secretary of the Board shall charge the direct costs, including operator time, of producing the copy. For other forms of duplication, the Secretary of the Board will charge the direct costs of that duplication.\n\n(iii) Review. Review fees shall be charged to requesters who make a commercial use request. Review fees shall be charged only for the initial record review—the review done when the Secretary of the Board determines whether an exemption applies to a particular record at the initial request level. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal level for an exemption already applied. However, records withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine whether any other exemption not previously considered applies, and the costs of that review are chargeable. Review fees shall be the direct costs of conducting the review by the involved employees.\n\n(iv) Limitations on charging fees. (A) No search fee will be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.\n\n(B) No search fee or review fee will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.\n\n(C) Whenever a total fee calculated under this paragraph is $25 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.\n\n(D) For requesters other than those seeking records for a commercial use, no fee will be charged unless the cost of search in excess of two hours plus the cost of duplication in excess of 100 pages totals more than $25.\n\n(2) Payment procedures. All persons requesting records pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section shall pay the applicable fees before the Secretary of the Board sends copies of the requested records, unless a fee waiver has been granted pursuant to paragraph (f)(6) of this section. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.\n\n(i) Advance notification of fees. If the estimated charges are likely to exceed $25, the Secretary of the Board shall notify the requester of the estimated amount, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Upon receipt of such notice, the requester may confer with the Secretary of the Board to reformulate the request to lower the costs. The processing of the request shall be suspended until the requester provides the Secretary of the Board with a written guarantee that payment will be made upon completion of the processing.\n\n(ii) Advance payment. The Secretary of the Board shall require advance payment of any fee estimated to exceed $250. The Secretary of the Board shall also require full payment in advance where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion. If an advance payment of an estimated fee exceeds the actual total fee by $1 or more, the difference shall be refunded to the requester. The time period for responding to requests under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, and the processing of the request shall be suspended until the Secretary of the Board receives the required payment.\n\n(iii) Late charges. The Secretary of the Board may assess interest charges when fee payment is not made within 30 days of the date on which the billing was sent. Assessment of such interest will commence on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. Interest is at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.\n\n(3) Categories of uses. The fees assessed depend upon the fee category. In determining which category is appropriate, the Secretary of the Board shall look to the identity of the requester and the intended use set forth in the request for records. Where a requester's description of the use is insufficient to make a determination, the Secretary of the Board may seek additional clarification before categorizing the request.\n\n(i) Commercial use requester. The fees for search, duplication, and review apply when records are requested for commercial use.\n\n(ii) Educational, non-commercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media requesters. The fees for duplication apply when records are not sought for commercial use, and the requester is a representative of the news media or an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research. The first 100 pages of duplication, however, will be provided free.\n\n(iii) All other requesters. For all other requests, the fees for search and duplication apply. The first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages of duplication, however, will be provided free.\n\n(4) Nonproductive search. Fees for search may be charged even if no responsive documents are found. Fees for search and review may be charged even if the request is denied.\n\n(5) Aggregated requests. A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. If the Secretary of the Board reasonably believes that a requester is separating a request into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees or that several requesters appear to be acting together to submit multiple requests solely in order to avoid payment of fees, the Secretary of the Board may aggregate such requests and charge accordingly. It is considered reasonable for the Secretary of the Board to presume that multiple requests by one requester on the same topic made within a 30-day period have been made to avoid fees.\n\n(6) Waiver or reduction of fees. A request for a waiver or reduction of the fees, and the justification for the waiver, shall be included with the request for records to which it pertains. If a waiver is requested and the requester has not indicated in writing an agreement to pay the applicable fees if the waiver request is denied, the time for response to the request for documents, as set forth in under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, shall not begin until a determination has been made on the request for a waiver or reduction of fees.\n\n(i) Standards for determining waiver or reduction. The Secretary of the Board may grant a waiver or reduction of fees where it is determined both that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operation or activities of the government, and that the disclosure of information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In making this determination, the following factors shall be considered:\n\n(A) Whether the subject of the records concerns the operations or activities of the government;\n\n(B) Whether disclosure of the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities;\n\n(C) Whether the requester has the intention and ability to disseminate the information to the public;\n\n(D) Whether the information is already in the public domain;\n\n(E) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the disclosure; and, if so,\n\n(F) Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\n\n(ii) Contents of request for waiver. A request for a waiver or reduction of fees shall include a clear statement of how the request satisfies the criteria set forth in paragraph (f)(6)(i) of this section.\n\n(iii) Burden of proof. The burden shall be on the requester to present evidence or information in support of a request for a waiver or reduction of fees.\n\n(iv) Determination by Secretary of the Board. The Secretary of the Board shall make a determination on the request for a waiver or reduction of fees and shall notify the requester accordingly. A denial may be appealed to the Board in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n(7) Uniform fee schedule.\n\n(g) Reuest for confidential treatment of business information—(1) Submission of request. Any submitter of information to the Board who desires confidential treatment of business information pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) shall file a request for confidential treatment with the Board at the time the information is submitted or a reasonable time after submission.\n\n(2) Form of request. Each request for confidential treatment of business information shall state in reasonable detail the facts supporting the commercial or financial nature of the business information and the legal justification under which the business information should be protected. Conclusory statements that release of the information would cause competitive harm generally will not be considered sufficient to justify confidential treatment.\n\n(3) Designation and separation of confidential material. All information considered confidential by a submitter shall be clearly designated “PROPRIETARY” or “BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL” in the submission and separated from information for which confidential treatment is not requested. Failure to segregate confidential commercial or financial information from other material may result in release of the nonsegregated material to the public without notice to the submitter.\n\n(h) Request for access to confidential commercial or financial information—(1) Request for confidential commercial or financial information. A request by a submitter for confidential treatment of any business information shall be considered in connection with a request for access to that information.\n\n(2) Notice to the submitter. (i) The Secretary of the Board shall notify a submitter who requested confidential treatment of information pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), of the request for access.\n\n(ii) Absent a request for confidential treatment, the Secretary of the Board may notify a submitter of a request for access to submitter's business information if the Secretary of the Board reasonably believes that disclosure of the information may cause substantial competitive harm to the submitter.\n\n(iii) The notice given to the submitter by mail, return receipt requested, shall be given as soon as practicable after receipt of the request for access, and shall describe the request and provide the submitter seven working days from the date of notice, to submit written objections to disclosure of the information. Such statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information and shall demonstrate why the information which is considered to be commercial or financial information, and that the information is a trade secret, is privileged or confidential, or that its disclosure is likely to cause substantial competitive harm to the submitter. If the submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to the release of the information. Information a submitter provides under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.\n\n(3) Exceptions to notice to submitter. Notice to the submitter need not be given if:\n\n(i) The Secretary of the Board determines that the request for access should be denied;\n\n(ii) The requested information lawfully has been made available to the public;\n\n(iii) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552); or\n\n(iv) The submitter's claim of confidentiality under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) appears obviously frivolous or has already been denied by the Secretary of the Board, except that in this last instance the Secretary of the Board shall give the submitter written notice of the determination to disclose the information at least seven working days prior to disclosure.\n\n(4) Notice to requester. At the same time the Secretary of the Board notifies the submitter, the Secretary of the Board also shall notify the requester that the request is subject to the provisions of this section.\n\n(5) Determination by Secretary of the Board. The Secretary of the Board's determination whether or not to disclose any information for which confidential treatment has been requested pursuant to this section shall be communicated to the submitter and the requester immediately. If the Secretary of the Board determines to disclose the business information over the objection of a submitter, the Secretary of the Board shall give the submitter written notice via mail, return receipt requested, or similar means, which shall include:\n\n(i) A statement of reason(s) why the submitter's objections to disclosure were not sustained;\n\n(ii) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and\n\n(iii) A statement that the component intends to disclose the information seven working days from the date the submitter receives the notice.\n\n(6) Notice of lawsuit. The Secretary of the Board shall promptly notify any submitter of information covered by this section of the filing of any suit against the Board to compel disclosure of such information, and shall promptly notify a requester of any suit filed against the Board to enjoin the disclosure of requested documents.\n\n[64 FR 57933, Oct. 27, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 70293, Nov. 22, 2000]",

    "content": "(a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect. The Board shall review the List of Debarred entities prior to making final loan Guarantee decisions. Suspension or debarment may be a basis for denying a loan Guarantee.\n\n(b) This section applies to all persons who have participated, are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of this section such transactions will be referred to as “covered transactions”.\n\n(1) Covered transaction. For purposes of this section, a covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve the transfer of Federal funds.\n\n(i) Primary covered transaction. Except as noted in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, contracts of assistance, loans, loan Guarantees, subsidies, insurance, payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person.\n\n(ii) Lower tier covered transaction. A lower tier covered transaction is:\n\n(A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a primary covered transaction;\n\n(B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $100,000) under a primary covered transaction;\n\n(C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons may include loan officers or chief executive officers acting as principal investigators and providers of federally-required audit services.\n\n(2) Exceptions. The following transactions are not covered:\n\n(i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;\n\n(ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign governmental entities;\n\n(iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);\n\n(iv) Federal employment;\n\n(v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized emergencies or disasters;\n\n(vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental operations; and\n\n(vii) Other transactions where the application of this section would be prohibited by law.\n\n(3) Board covered transactions. This section applies to the Board's loan Guarantees, subcontracts and transactions at any tier that are charges as direct or indirect costs, regardless of type.\n\n(c) Primary covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited by law, persons who are debarred or suspended shall be excluded from primary covered transactions as either participants or principals throughout the Executive Branch of the Federal Government for the period of their debarment, suspension, or the period they are proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4. Accordingly, no agency shall enter into primary covered transactions with such excluded persons during such period, except as permitted pursuant to paragraph (l) of this section.\n\n(d) Lower tier covered transactions. Except to the extent prohibited by law, persons who have been proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, debarred or suspended shall be excluded from participating as either participants or principals in all lower tier covered transactions (see paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section for the period of their exclusion.\n\n(e) Exceptions. Debarment or suspension does not affect a person's eligibility for—\n\n(1) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including deposited funds insured by the Federal Government;\n\n(2) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, and entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign governmental entities;\n\n(3) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted);\n\n(4) Federal employment;\n\n(5) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized emergencies or disasters;\n\n(6) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental operations; and\n\n(7) Other transactions where the application of this section would be prohibited by law.\n\n(f) Persons who are ineligible are excluded in accordance with the applicable statutory, executive order, or regulatory authority.\n\n(g) Persons who accept voluntary exclusions are excluded in accordance with the terms of their settlements. The Board shall, and participants may, contact the original action agency to ascertain the extent of the exclusion.\n\n(h) The Board may grant an exception permitting a debarred, suspended, or voluntarily excluded person, or a person proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, to participate in a particular covered transaction upon a written determination by the agency head or an authorized designee stating the reason(s) for deviating from the Presidential policy established by Executive Order 12549. However, in accordance with the President's stated intention in the Executive Order, exceptions shall be granted only infrequently. Exceptions shall be reported in accordance with the Executive Order.\n\n(i) Notwithstanding the debarment, suspension, proposed debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion of any person by an agency, agencies and participants may continue covered transactions in existence at the time the person was debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded. A decision as to the type of termination action, if any, to be taken should be made only after thorough review to ensure the propriety of the proposed action.\n\n(j) Agencies and participants shall not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any person who is debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, ineligible or voluntary excluded, except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.\n\n(k) Except as permitted under paragraphs (h) or (i) of this section, a participant shall not knowingly do business under a covered transaction with a person who is—\n\n(1) Debarred or suspended;\n\n(2) Proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4; or\n\n(3) Ineligible for or voluntarily excluded from the covered transaction.\n\n(l) Violation of the restriction under paragraph (k) of this section may result in disallowance of costs, annulment or termination of award, issuance of a stop work order, debarment or suspension, or other remedies as appropriate.\n\n(m) A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it and its principals are not debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is erroneous. An agency has the burden of proof that a participant did knowingly do business with a person that filed an erroneous certification.",

(1) This paragraph describes various classes of Board actions that normally do not have a significant impact on the human environment and are categorically excluded. The word “normally” is stressed; there may be individual cases in which specific factors require contrary action.\n\n(ii) Subject to the limitations in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section, the actions described in this paragraph have been determined not to have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. They are categorically excluded from the need to prepare an environmental assessment or an EIS under NEPA.\n\n(A) Guarantees of working capital loans; and\n\n(B) Guarantees of loans for the refinancing of outstanding indebtedness of the Borrower, regardless of the purpose for which the original indebtedness was incurred.\n\n(iii) Actions listed in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section that otherwise are categorically excluded from NEPA review are not necessarily excluded from review if they would be located within, or in other cases, potentially affect:\n\n(A) A floodplain;\n\n(B) A wetland;\n\n(C) Important farmlands, or prime forestlands or rangelands;\n\n(D) A listed species or critical habitat for an endangered species;\n\n(E) A property that is listed on or may be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places;\n\n(F) An area within an approved State Coastal Zone Management Program;\n\n(G) A coastal barrier or a portion of a barrier within the Coastal Barrier Resources System;\n\n(H) A river or portion of a river included in, or designated for, potential addition to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System;\n\n(I) A sole source aquifer recharge area;\n\n(J) A State water quality standard (including designated and/or existing beneficial uses and anti-degradation requirements); or\n\n(K) The release or disposal of regulated substances above the levels set forth in a permit or license issued by an appropriate regulatory authority.\n\n(5) Responsibilities and procedures for preparation of an environmental assessment. (i) the Executive Director will request that the Lender and Borrower provide information concerning all potentially significant environmental impacts of the Borrower's proposed project pursuant to 13 CFR 400.206. The Executive Director, consulting at his discretion with CEQ, will review the information provided by the Lender and Borrower. Though no specific format for an environmental assessment is prescribed, it shall be a separate document, suitable for public review and should include the following in conformance with 40 CFR 1508.9:\n\n(A) Description of the environment. The existing environmental conditions relevant to the Board's analysis determining the environmental impacts of the proposed project, should be described. The no action alternative also should be discussed;\n\n(B) Documentation. Citations to information used to describe the existing environment and to assess environmental impacts should be clearly referenced and documented. These sources should include, as appropriate, but not be limited to, local, tribal, regional, State, and Federal agencies, as well as, public and private organizations and institutions;\n\n(C) Evaluating environmental consequences of proposed actions. A brief discussion should be included of the need for the proposal, of alternatives as required by 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(E) and their environmental impacts. The discussion of the environmental impacts should include measures to mitigate adverse impacts and any irreversible or irretrievable commitments of resources to the proposed project.\n\n(ii) The Executive Director, in preparing an environmental assessment, may:\n\n(A) Tier upon the information contained in a previous EIS, as described in 40 CFR 1502.20;\n\n(B) Incorporate by reference reasonably available material, as described in 40 CFR 1502.21; and/or\n\n(C) Adopt a previously completed EIS reasonably related to the project for which the proceeds of the loan sought to be guaranteed under the Program will be used, as described in 40 CFR 1506.3.\n\n(iii) Because of the statute's admonition to the Board to make its decisions as soon as possible after receiving applications, the Board will not:\n\n(A) Publish notice of intent to prepare an environmental assessment, as describe in 40 CFR 1501.7;\n\n(B) Conduct scoping, as described in 40 CFR 1501.7; and\n\n(C) Seek comments on the environmental assessment, as described in 40 CFR 1503.1.\n\n(iv) If, on the basis of an environmental assessment, it is determined that an EIS is not required, a FONSI, as described in 40 CFR 1508.13 will be prepared. The FONSI will include the environmental assessment or a summary of it and be available to the public from the Board. The Executive Director shall maintain a record of these decisions, making them available to interested parties upon request. Requests should be directed to the Executive Director, Emergency Steel Guarantee Loan Program, 1099—14th Street, NW, Suite 2600 East, Washington, DC 20005. Prior to a final loan guarantee decision, a copy of the NEPA documentation shall be sent to the Board for consideration.\n\n(6) Responsibilities and procedures for preparation of an environmental impact statement. (i) If after an environmental assessment has been completed, it is determined that an EIS is necessary, it and other related documentation will be prepared by the Executive Director in accordance with section 102(2)(c) of NEPA, this section, and 40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508. The Executive Director may seek additional information from the applicant in preparing the EIS. Once the document is prepared, it shall be submitted to the Board. If the Board considers a document unsatisfactory, it shall be returned to the Executive Director for revision or supplementation prior to a loan guarantee decision; otherwise the Board will transmit the document to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n(ii)(A) The following procedures, as discussed in 40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508, will be followed in preparing an EIS:\n\n(1) The format and contents of the draft and final EIS shall be as discussed in 40 CFR 1502.\n\n(2) The requirements of 40 CFR 1506.9 for filing of documents with the Environmental Protection Agency shall be followed.\n\n(3) The Executive Director, consulting at his discretion with CEQ, shall examine carefully the basis on which supportive studies have been conducted to assure that such studies are objective and comprehensive in scope and in depth.\n\n(4) NEPA requires that the decision making “utilize a systematic, interdisciplinary approach that will ensure the integrated use of the natural and social sciences and the environmental design arts.” 42 U.S.C. 4332(A). If such disciplines are not present on the Board staff, appropriate use should be made of personnel of Federal, State, and local agencies, universities, non-profit organizations, or private industry.\n\n(B) Until the Board issues a record of decision as provided in 40 CFR 1502.2 no action concerning the proposal shall be taken which would:\n\n(1) Have an adverse environmental impact; or\n\n(2) Limit the choice of reasonable alternatives.\n\n(3) 40 CFR 1506.10 places certain limitations on the timing of Board decisions on taking “major Federal actions.” A loan guarantee shall not be made before the times set forth in 40 CFR 1506.10.\n\n(iii) A public record of decision stating what the decision was; identifying alternatives that were considered, including the environmentally preferable one(s); discussing any national considerations that entered into the decision; and summarizing a monitoring and enforcement program if applicable for mitigating the environmental effects of a proposal; will be prepared. This record of decision will be prepared at the time the decision is made.\n\n[64 FR 57933, Oct. 27, 1999, as amended at 64 FR 72021, Dec. 23, 1999; 65 FR 70294, Nov. 22, 2000]",

    "content": "(a) Definitions. All terms used in this section which are defined in 5 U.S.C. 551 or 5 U.S.C. 552 shall have the same meaning in this section. In addition the following definitions apply to this section:\n\n(1) FOIA, as used in this section, means the “Freedom of Information Act,” as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552.\n\n(2) Commercial use request means a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made.\n\n(3) Direct costs mean those expenditures that the Board actually incurs in searching for, reviewing, and duplicating documents in response to a request made under paragraph (c) of this section. Direct costs include, for example, the labor costs of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits). Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are kept.\n\n(4) Duplication means the process of making a copy of a document in response to a request for disclosure of records or for inspection of original records that contain exempt material or that otherwise cannot be inspected directly. Among others, such copies may take the form of paper, microfilm, audiovisual materials, or machine-readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk).\n\n(5) Educational institution means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, or an institution of undergraduate higher education, graduate higher education, professional education, or an institution of vocational education that operates a program of scholarly research.\n\n(6) Noncommercial scientific institution refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis (as that term is used in this section) and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.\n\n(7) News means information about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include, but are not limited to, television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of newspapers and other periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. “Freelance” journalists may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it.\n\n(8) Representative of the news media means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the general public.\n\n(9) Review means the process of examining documents, located in response to a request for access, to determine whether any portion of a document is exempt information. It includes doing all that is necessary to excise the documents and otherwise to prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.\n\n(10) Search means the process of looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification within documents. Searches may be done manually or by computer.\n\n(b) Records available for public inspection and copying—(1) Types of records made available. The information in this section is furnished for the guidance of the public and in compliance with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552) (FOIA). This section sets forth the procedures the Board follows to make publicly available the materials specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). These materials shall be made available for inspection and copying at the Board's Freedom of Information Office pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). Information routinely provided to the public as part of a regular Board activity (for example, press releases) may be provided to the public without following this section.\n\n(2) Reading room procedures. Information available under this section is available for inspection and copying, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. weekdays, at the Freedom of Information Office of the Board, Oil and Gas Guarantee Loan Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230.\n\n(3) Electronic records. Information available under this section that was created on or after November 1, 1996, shall also be available on the Board's website, found at www.doc.gov.\n\n(c) Records available to the public on request—(1) Types of records made available. All records of the Board that are not available under paragraph (b) of this section shall be made available upon request, pursuant to the procedures in this section and the exceptions set forth in the FOIA. The Board's policy is to make discretionary disclosures of records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption, but this policy does not create any right enforceable in court.\n\n(2) Procedures for requesting records. A request for records shall reasonably describe the records in a way that enables the Board's staff to identify and produce the records with reasonable effort and without unduly burdening or significantly interfering with any of the Board's operations. The request shall be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the Board, Oil and Gas Guarantee Loan Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230; or sent by facsimile to the Secretary of the Board. The request shall be clearly marked FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST.\n\n(3) Contents of request. The request shall contain the following information:\n\n(i) The name and address of the requester, and the telephone number at which the requester can be reached during normal business hours;\n\n(ii) Whether the requested information is intended for commercial use, or whether the requester represents an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, or news media;\n\n(iii) A statement agreeing to pay the applicable fees, or a statement identifying any fee limitation desired, or a request for a waiver or reduction of fees that satisfies paragraph (f) of this section.\n\n(d) Processing requests—(1) Priority of responses. The date of receipt for any request, including one that is addressed incorrectly or that is referred to the Board by another agency, is the date the Secretary of the Board actually receives the request. The Secretary of the Board shall normally process requests in the order they are received. However, in the Secretary of the Board's discretion, the Board may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based on the number of pages involved, or some other measure of the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request, and whether the request qualifies for expedited processing as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. When using multitrack processing, the Secretary of the Board may provide requesters in the slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing. The Secretary of the Board shall contact the requester by telephone or by letter, whichever is most efficient in each case.\n\n(2) Expedited processing. (i) A person may request expedited access to records by submitting a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, that demonstrates a compelling need for the records, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(E)(v).\n\n(ii) The Secretary of the Board shall notify a requester of the determination whether to grant or deny a request for expedited processing within ten working days of receipt of the request. If the Secretary of the Board grants the request for expedited processing, the Board shall process the request for access to information as soon as practicable. If the Secretary of the Board denies a request for expedited processing, the requester may file an appeal pursuant to the procedures set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, and the Board shall respond to the appeal within twenty days after the appeal was received by the Board.\n\n(3) Time limits. The time for response to requests shall be 20 working days, except:\n\n(i) In the case of expedited treatment under paragraph (d)(2) of this section;\n\n(ii) Where the running of such time is suspended for payment of fees pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section;\n\n(iii) Where the estimated charge is less than $250, and the requester does not guarantee payment pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section; or\n\n(iv) In unusual circumstances, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(iii), the time limit may be extended for a period of time not to exceed 10 working days as provided by written notice to the requester, setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched; or such alternative time period as mutually agreed to by the Secretary of the Board and the requester when the Secretary of the Board notifies the requester that the request cannot be processed in the specified time limit.\n\n(4) Response to request. In response to a request that satisfies paragraph (c) of this paragraph, an appropriate search shall be conducted of records in the custody and control of the Board on the date of receipt of the request, and a review made of any responsive information located. The Secretary of the Board shall notify the requester of:\n\n(i) The Secretary of the Board's determination of the request and the reasons therefor;\n\n(ii) The information withheld, and the basis for withholding; and\n\n(iii) The right to appeal any denial or partial denial, pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n(5) Referral to another agency. To the extent a request covers documents that were created by, obtained from, classified by, or is in the primary interest of another agency, the Secretary of the Board may refer the request to that agency for a direct response by that agency and inform the requester promptly of the referral. The Secretary of the Board shall consult with another Federal agency before responding to a requester if the Board receives a request for a record in which:\n\n(i) Another Federal agency subject to the FOIA has a significant interest, but not the primary interest; or\n\n(ii) Another Federal agency not subject to the FOIA has the primary interest or a significant interest. Ordinarily, the agency that originated a record will be presumed to have the primary interest in it.\n\n(6) Providing responsive records. (i) A copy of records or portions of records responsive to the request shall be sent to the requester by regular U.S. mail to the address indicated in the request, unless the requester elects to take delivery of the documents at the Board's Freedom of Information Office or makes other acceptable arrangements, or the Secretary of the Board deems it appropriate to send the documents by another means. The Secretary of the Board shall provide a copy of the record in any form or format requested if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format, but the Secretary of the Board need not provide more than one copy of any record to a requester.\n\n(ii) The Secretary of the Board shall provide any reasonably segregable portion of a record that is responsive to the request after deleting those portions that are exempt under the FOIA or this section.\n\n(iii) Except where disclosure is expressly prohibited by statute, regulation, or order, the Secretary of the Board may authorize the release of records that are exempt from mandatory disclosure whenever the Board or designated Board members determine that there would be no foreseeable harm in such disclosure.\n\n(iv) The Board is not required in response to the request to create records or otherwise to prepare new records.\n\n(7) Prohibition against disclosure. Except as provided in this part, no officer, employee, or agent of the Board shall disclose or permit the disclosure of any unpublished information of the Board to any person (other than Board officers, employees, or agents properly entitled to such information for the performance of official duties), unless required by law.\n\n(e) Appeals. (1) Any person denied access to Board records requested under paragraph (c) of this section, denied expedited processing under paragraph (d) of this section, or denied a waiver of fees under paragraph (f) of this section may file a written appeal within 30 calendar days after the date of such denial with the Board. The written appeal shall prominently display the phrase FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT APPEAL on the first page, and shall be addressed to the General Counsel of the Board, Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Board, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230; or sent by facsimile to the General Counsel of the Board. The appeal shall include a copy of the original request, the initial denial, if any, and a statement of the reasons why the requested records should be made available and why the initial denial was in error.\n\n(2) The General Counsel of the Board shall make a determination regarding any appeal within 20 working days of actual receipt of the appeal, and the determination letter shall notify the appealing party of the right to seek judicial review in event of denial.\n\n(f) Fee schedules; waiver of fees—(1) Fee schedule. The fees applicable to a request for records pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section are set forth in the uniform fee schedule at the end of this paragraph (b).\n\n(i) Search. (A) Search fees shall be charged for all requests—other than requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media—subject to the limitations of paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section. The Secretary of the Board shall charge for time spent searching even if no responsive record is located or if the Secretary of the Board withholds the record(s) located as entirely exempt from disclosure. Search fees shall be the direct costs of conducting the search by the involved employees.\n\n(B) For computer searches of records, requesters will be charged the direct costs of conducting the search, although certain requesters (as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section) will be charged no search fee and certain other requesters (as provided in paragraph (f)(3)) are entitled to the cost equivalent of two hours of manual search time without charge. These direct costs include the costs, attributable to the search, of operating a central processing unit and operator/programmer salary.\n\n(ii) Duplication. Duplication fees will be charged to all requesters, subject to the limitations of paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section. For a paper photocopy of a record (no more than one copy of which need be supplied), the fee shall be 15 cents per page. For copies produced by computer, such as tapes or printouts, the Secretary of the Board shall charge the direct costs, including operator time, of producing the copy. For other forms of duplication, the Secretary of the Board will charge the direct costs of that duplication.\n\n(iii) Review. Review fees shall be charged to requesters who make a commercial use request. Review fees shall be charged only for the initial record review—the review done when the Secretary of the Board determines whether an exemption applies to a particular record at the initial request level. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal level for an exemption already applied. However, records withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine whether any other exemption not previously considered applies, and the costs of that review are chargeable. Review fees shall be the direct costs of conducting the review by the involved employees.\n\n(iv) Limitations on charging fees. (A) No search fee will be charged for requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.\n\n(B) No search fee or review fee will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.\n\n(C) Whenever a total fee calculated under this paragraph is $25 or less for any request, no fee will be charged.\n\n(D) For requesters other than those seeking records for a commercial use, no fee will be charged unless the cost of search in excess of two hours plus the cost of duplication in excess of 100 pages totals more than $25.\n\n(2) Payment procedures. All persons requesting records pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section shall pay the applicable fees before the Secretary of the Board sends copies of the requested records, unless a fee waiver has been granted pursuant to paragraph (f)(6) of this section. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.\n\n(i) Advance notification of fees. If the estimated charges are likely to exceed $25, the Secretary of the Board shall notify the requester of the estimated amount, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Upon receipt of such notice, the requester may confer with the Secretary of the Board to reformulate the request to lower the costs. The processing of the request shall be suspended until the requester provides the Secretary of the Board with a written guarantee that payment will be made upon completion of the processing.\n\n(ii) Advance payment. The Secretary of the Board shall require advance payment of any fee estimated to exceed $250. The Secretary of the Board shall also require full payment in advance where a requester has previously failed to pay a fee in a timely fashion. If an advance payment of an estimated fee exceeds the actual total fee by $1 or more, the difference shall be refunded to the requester. The time period for responding to requests under paragraph (d)(4) of this section, and the processing of the request shall be suspended until the Secretary of the Board receives the required payment.\n\n(iii) Late charges. The Secretary of the Board may assess interest charges when fee payment is not made within 30 days of the date on which the billing was sent. Assessment of such interest will commence on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. Interest is at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.\n\n(3) Categories of uses. The fees assessed depend upon the fee category. In determining which category is appropriate, the Secretary of the Board shall look to the identity of the requester and the intended use set forth in the request for records. Where a requester's description of the use is insufficient to make a determination, the Secretary of the Board may seek additional clarification before categorizing the request.\n\n(i) Commercial use requester. The fees for search, duplication, and review apply when records are requested for commercial use.\n\n(ii) Educational, non-commercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media requesters. The fees for duplication apply when records are not sought for commercial use, and the requester is a representative of the news media or an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research. The first 100 pages of duplication, however, will be provided free.\n\n(iii) All other requesters. For all other requests, the fees for search and duplication apply. The first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages of duplication, however, will be provided free.\n\n(4) Nonproductive search. Fees for search may be charged even if no responsive documents are found. Fees for search and review may be charged even if the request is denied.\n\n(5) Aggregated requests. A requester may not file multiple requests at the same time, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. If the Secretary of the Board reasonably believes that a requester is separating a request into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees or that several requesters appear to be acting together to submit multiple requests solely in order to avoid payment of fees, the Secretary of the Board may aggregate such requests and charge accordingly. It is considered reasonable for the Secretary of the Board to presume that multiple requests by one requester on the same topic made within a 30-day period have been made to avoid fees.\n\n(6) Waiver or reduction of fees. A request for a waiver or reduction of the fees, and the justification for the waiver, shall be included with the request for records to which it pertains. If a waiver is requested and the requester has not indicated in writing an agreement to pay the applicable fees if the waiver request is denied, the time for response to the request for documents, as set forth in paragraph (4)(d) of this section, shall not begin until a determination has been made on the request for a waiver or reduction of fees.\n\n(i) Standards for determining waiver or reduction. The Secretary of the Board may grant a waiver or reduction of fees where it is determined both that disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operation or activities of the government, and that the disclosure of information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In making this determination, the following factors shall be considered:\n\n(A) Whether the subject of the records concerns the operations or activities of the government;\n\n(B) Whether disclosure of the information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities;\n\n(C) Whether the requester has the intention and ability to disseminate the information to the public;\n\n(D) Whether the information is already in the public domain;\n\n(E) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the disclosure; and, if so,\n\n(F) Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.\n\n(ii) Contents of request for waiver. A request for a waiver or reduction of fees shall include a clear statement of how the request satisfies the criteria set forth in paragraph (f)(6)(i) of this section.\n\n(iii) Burden of proof. The burden shall be on the requester to present evidence or information in support of a request for a waiver or reduction of fees.\n\n(iv) Determination by Secretary of the Board. The Secretary of the Board shall make a determination on the request for a waiver or reduction of fees and shall notify the requester accordingly. A denial may be appealed to the Board in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.\n\n(7) Uniform fee schedule.\n\n(g) Request for confidential treatment of business information—(1) Submission of request. Any submitter of information to the Board who desires confidential treatment of business information pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) shall file a request for confidential treatment with the Board at the time the information is submitted or a reasonable time after submission.\n\n(2) Form of request. Each request for confidential treatment of business information shall state in reasonable detail the facts supporting the commercial or financial nature of the business information and the legal justification under which the business information should be protected. Conclusory statements that release of the information would cause competitive harm generally will not be considered sufficient to justify confidential treatment.\n\n(3) Designation and separation of confidential material. All information considered confidential by a submitter shall be clearly designated “PROPRIETARY” or “BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL” in the submission and separated from information for which confidential treatment is not requested. Failure to segregate confidential commercial or financial information from other material may result in release of the nonsegregated material to the public without notice to the submitter.\n\n(h) Request for access to confidential commercial or financial information—(1) Request for confidential commercial or financial information. A request by a submitter for confidential treatment of any business information shall be considered in connection with a request for access to that information.\n\n(2) Notice to the submitter. (i) The Secretary of the Board shall notify a submitter who requested confidential treatment of information pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), of the request for access.\n\n(ii) Absent a request for confidential treatment, the Secretary of the Board may notify a submitter of a request for access to submitter's business information if the Secretary of the Board reasonably believes that disclosure of the information may cause substantial competitive harm to the submitter.\n\n(iii) The notice given to the submitter by mail, return receipt requested, shall be given as soon as practicable after receipt of the request for access, and shall describe the request and provide the submitter seven working days from the date of notice, to submit written objections to disclosure of the information. Such statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information and shall demonstrate why the information which is considered to be commercial or financial information, and that the information is a trade secret, is privileged or confidential, or that its disclosure is likely to cause substantial competitive harm to the submitter. If the submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to the release of the information. Information a submitter provides under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.\n\n(3) Exceptions to notice to submitter. Notice to the submitter need not be given if:\n\n(i) The Secretary of the Board determines that the request for access should be denied;\n\n(ii) The requested information lawfully has been made available to the public;\n\n(iii) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552); or\n\n(iv) The submitter's claim of confidentiality under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) appears obviously frivolous or has already been denied by the Secretary of the Board, except that in this last instance the Secretary of the Board shall give the submitter written notice of the determination to disclose the information at least seven working days prior to disclosure.\n\n(4) Notice to requester. At the same time the Secretary of the Board notifies the submitter, the Secretary of the Board also shall notify the requester that the request is subject to the provisions of this section.\n\n(5) Determination by Secretary of the Board. The Secretary of the Board's determination whether or not to disclose any information for which confidential treatment has been requested pursuant to this section shall be communicated to the submitter and the requester immediately. If the Secretary of the Board determines to disclose the business information over the objection of a submitter, the Secretary of the Board shall give the submitter written notice via mail, return receipt requested, or similar means, which shall include:\n\n(i) A statement of reason(s) why the submitter's objections to disclosure were not sustained;\n\n(ii) A description of the business information to be disclosed; and\n\n(iii) A statement that the component intends to disclose the information seven working days from the date the submitter receives the notice.\n\n(6) Notice of lawsuit. The Secretary of the Board shall promptly notify any submitter of information covered by this section of the filing of any suit against the Board to compel disclosure of such information, and shall promptly notify a requester of any suit filed against the Board to enjoin the disclosure of requested documents.",

    "content": "(a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect. The Board shall review the List of Debarred entities prior to making final loan Guarantee decisions. Suspension or debarment may be a basis for denying a loan Guarantee.\n\n(b) This section applies to all persons who have participated, are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of this section such transactions will be referred to as “covered transactions”.\n\n(1) Covered transaction. For purposes of this section, a covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve the transfer of Federal funds.\n\n(i) Primary covered transaction. Except as noted in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, including: grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, contracts of assistance, loans, loan Guarantees, subsidies, insurance, payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person.\n\n(ii) Lower tier covered transaction.

However, in accordance with the President's stated intention in the Executive Order, exceptions shall be granted only infrequently. Exceptions shall be reported in accordance with the Executive Order.\n\n(i) Notwithstanding the debarment, suspension, proposed debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion of any person by an agency, agencies and participants may continue covered transactions in existence at the time the person was debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded.

If such disciplines are not present on the Board staff, appropriate use should be made of personnel of Federal, State, and local agencies, universities, non-profit organizations, or private industry.\n\n(B) Until the Board issues a record of decision as provided in 40 CFR 1502.2 no action concerning the proposal shall be taken which would:\n\n(1) Have an adverse environmental impact; or\n\n(2) Limit the choice of reasonable alternatives.\n\n(3) 40 CFR 1506.10 places certain limitations on the timing of Board decisions on taking “major Federal actions.” A loan guarantee shall not be make before the times set forth in 40 CFR 1506.10.\n\n(iii) A public record of decision stating what the decision was; identifying alternatives that were considered, including the environmentally preferable one(s); discussing any national considerations that entered into the decision; and summarizing a monitoring and enforcement program if applicable for mitigating the environmental effects of a proposal; will be prepared. This record of decision will be prepared at the time the decision is made.\n\n[64 FR 57947, Oct. 27, 1999, as amended at 64 FR 72024, Dec. 23, 1999]",
